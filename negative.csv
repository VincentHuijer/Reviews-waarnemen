After minimal breaking in (around the house and on paved streets in my neighborhood), I wore them on a 5 week trip where we hiked every single day.
The majority of the hikes were in the 'moderate-to-difficult' category, averaging 5 miles in length, but ranging from 3-15.
I especially felt they protected my toes and soles well when hiking on loose, rocky terrain.
I feel they do have a bit of a narrow fit, which works for my foot shape but others may want to consider trying the Wide version if this is an issue.
I normally wear a 7.5 or 8 and the 8 was just too narrow for me.
The shoe is pretty comfortable and the back of my heels dont rub, but I noticed a bit of pain in the bottom of my heel so I wanted to put a gel insert in it.
(Its a cheap AirPlus super gel insole if anyone was wondering).
I personally like them with the insert since the sole is somewhat stiff.
I have a camping trip in the next few days and I will update afterwards on how they held up.
Yo siempre tengo problema con torceduras y con estas botas ya no tengo que preocuparme de eso!
Las he usado en bosque, Cascadas, ciudad y no me han quedado mal ni una vez!
I usually wear a 7 for sneakers (6.5 for heels), and have a normal to high arch with neutral alignment.Bought these in a 7 after reading reviews and immediately wore them to hike in the Saguaro National Park without any blisters or rubbing.
Im properly impressed.
But given these are deemed hiking boots I was wary that a 9 would be too tight.
Not too small not too big.
I could wear them from day one, didn't take anything, if at all, to break them in.
I've worn them in muddy, wet weather -- and no leaking.
I have never tried wide version of any shoes before but I found this shoes to be too narrow at the sides.
Since feet will expand in long hikes I assume it will hurt my foot if I use this so I just sold it to my cousin whose feet is one size smaller than mine.
1700 foot elevation gain/loss out/back trail - really tested the fit and support.
Kept my feet dry.
Wear snug boot socks not just any long sock.
I did get a blister on my pinky toe the 1st 2 days I wore them but that was because I did not break them in slowly.
They are also waterproof And warm enough for the Winter but not too warm.
Low-and-behold the ones I liked were the most expensive but wow these are worth every penny.They are super comfortable (no need to break them in either) and have kept my feet warm (with 1 pair of socks) & dry (in rain & snow).
i tromped through water and mud with these and kept my feet perfectly dry.
There isn't any arch support as well.
Like a little higher than the left foot (also has insert) Over all it's nice shoe though.
It was muddy and there was ice on the ground but these boots kept my feet dry and me stable on thecground
Completely waterproof and didn't hurt my feet after Hiking  Zion in slush and snow.
I figured I would have to break these in for a little while before they would be truly comfortable.
I was wrong.
I put them on and just walked around outside for a while.
Kept my feet warm and didnt have any pain at all or discomfort.
No break in required, but I had to try a few different pairs of socks before finding ones that didnt rub at the seam.
I'm just starting to hike so I didn't want to spend too much on boots.
I bought these waterproof boots for my job shovelling horse manure.
just a bit too narrow.
cannot wear heavy socks with them
The first pair of these I got were not fully waterproof but I ordered a replacement and my issue was solved!
As soon as I put them on, I felt like I was ready to get outside and out them to use.
I used them for the first time during a small 2 mile hike and my feet didnt hurt and I didnt feel cramped!
Once I wore them more and they were broken in, I decided I will be investing in insoles as my feet did start to get a bit achey.
I think that also had to do with the distance I was walking, though I would like to get more miles in these babies without feeling any pain.
I really don't have any negatives to say about these, each time I put them on I was reminded why I love them so much and how I made such a good call in buying them.
The trip isn't until July so I just wear them around to make sure they are comfortable.
I was able to take this new pair out of the box and immediately start hiking comfortably!
Slogging through several puddles will eventually cause your socks to get damp.I think the grip or traction is ok for dry weather.
However tree roots or slick logs - traction is poor for me.
I fell down several times trying to walk on ice in these.
Not the boots fault, I wasn't wearing ice spikes.
Just don't wear them in winter weather.There are no signs of the boot peeling open or falling apart which is great.One negative is that the upper tongue portion becomes floppy and loose during hiking.
Lacing up the boots tighter doesn't help because the tie sort of slides down under the label leaving an inch or so closest to your ankle free to move and loosen, causing the boot to not feel secure on the foot.
Helps make feet less sore after a long hike lolAfter 2 years of heavy use, they're beginning to come apart at the toe and a little stiff.
Too stiff to be comfortable for all day hikes or backpacking at this pointI did buy new inserts to add some more support because the original inserts didn't have the best support
It's been 4 years already and I'm still using them!
I needed a lightweight boot that could withhold heavy WNS decontamination protocols after use.
These shoes are used and abused and withhold well.
The are lightweight and have great traction, however they are not the most comfortable so if youre wanted a comfy hiking shoe this might not be the one.
I haven't put in any inliners and it seems like I won't need to.
No blisters or discomfort at all the whole time!
I haven't worn these outside, so I don't know how waterproof they will be.
While everyone around me was slipping these did not!
Ive hiked about 500 miles (and walked even more) in these replacing the insoles 3 times.
These shoes are just now getting slippery due to tread wearing down.
I used to be a total Keens fan, but once I noticed that the shoes were wearing out a lot quicker, made the switch.
I live in cold Minnesota and they keep my feet very warm, But I do slip on ice here and there.
I have walked with it through puddles and water canyons and stays dry!
Just don't walk through ankle deep waters lol.
I I have normal arch type of footing and have walked miles in these shoes and these are the only shoes I have ever owned to not cause back strain or hip strain.
The only thing I wish didn't happen so often is it getting untied.
But that might just be user error and I'm not tying it correctly.
I wore it in every kind of condition (rain, snow, sand, mudetc) for a year every single day eventually worn it out.
So if you ever make the mistake that I did by thinking that the water wasnt that deep and then you end up stepping into a hole and water goes all into your shoe dont you worry a thing.
We walked over to a rock took off our shoes and socks to let them dry out and of course we had a towel with us so we took the towel to squeeze the inside of the shoes out and within 15 minutes our boots and wool socks were practically dry!!!
I have never had a hiking boot to get submerged in water and then once Ive squeezed all the water out of it I was able to put these boots back on within 15 minutes just taking a break letting them dry and there was no slashing or anything and we hiked for another 2 hours in those boots!
My daughter has a another pair of the same boots in a different color scheme and we were blown away about how quickly these dry.
Weve also worn them across the DFW Texas area and all the state parks out there and weve had zero issues with them!
I was skeptical about the other reviews saying the fit was right and there was no need to break in the boots, but its true!
My feet stay dry, the mud wipes off the uppers, and the tread is solid so my footing is stable even on the rockiest shore.In the summer I do a lot of mountain hikes and I think these would hold up to that use as well.
I could work with this though so im not returning it, still comfy enough!
The insoles are removable so you can easily change the insoles if youd want more arch support.
I bought these for my walks.
They are not leather they are a plastic outer material.
The plastic outer gets cold and since they are unline, even two pairs of socks don't keep my feet warm.
These might be good for spring or summer but no way for cold winter walking.
I deal with steep grades, uneven ground, rocks, brush, and sometimes deep mud.
The only issue is toe boxing, which can sometimes really pinch when walking uphill.
Amazon suggested to buy 7.5 which is too loose.
Light weight and easy to walk in.
Mis botas preferidas para caminar todo el da.
I wore them all day to break them in a bit and see how long til they botherd my feet and wear they would hurt at, shoes in general will usually start to hurt within a few hours and I have to change shoes.
These are super comfy nice cushioning on the bottom of feet and no rub on my pinky toes or big toe.
One common complait I read for many ppl was the "box toe" and the crease rub was tough on the big toe or toes, I did not have any rubbing tho i could feel the crease touch my toe it did not rub or hurt.
The ankles and tongue are very padded, the marteral is soft there is nothing hard or rough no pain was involved i had on short socks there was nothing between the boot and my skin.
I also tried in heavy rain as half hour walking and still part of shoes are dry.
The rest are wet as water goes down from my jeans.
So i can not complain about that.
Bought these because my Bear Paw hiking boots were not doing the trick.
I wore them in Iceland, doing plenty of difficult hikes and very wet hikes.
It looks tough and durable, I can't wait to test it in harsh conditions.
However, it would be better if the material were genuine leather.
Disappointing!
My wife has had these same boots for several years and although she wears them mainly during the winter, her boots still look like new, practically no wear at all.
I did not have to break them in.
I did "light" hiking in them over several days and they worked fine.
I did not wade through water but did hike in rain and my feet stay cozy and dry.I found them to be a low cost option for the nonserious hiker or tourist.
it gets everywhere and even my food service non-slips were no match for it.
Its like there is no powder unless its a very thick layer.
Just make sure youre wearing thick cotton or wool socks for better fit, as these are hiking boots designed with those socks in mind.
The only two downfalls are the soles wear out quickly in my opinion and I have to wear Superfeet EVERYDAY Comfort insoles in them.
Se ven resistentes para lo que se requiere aunque solo los he usado una vez para caminar (4 km) en el parque para sentirlos ya que los compr para viajar a un lugar fro.
Of course, we decided to climb the boulders vs staying to the left and going up along the stream to the glacier.
I was in disbelief that I didnt fall, break an ankle or blister my feet.
I need to mention that this was the first day wearing them and I went on to wear them everyday for 2 weeks straight.
I cannot recall a time that I slipped or twisted my ankle.
I felt the boot material was stiff, and I doubted that it would ever feel comfortable.
However, by then I'd already worn the boots outside.
I figured I'd suck it up and wear thick socks.Well, fast forward about 2 weeks and what a difference!
I'd probably be able to wear an 8.5 and still have thick socks on, for example.
Even with heavy socks, my foot shifts around a little bit (but doesn't rub or blister) in the 9.
I am still wearing them, but more as my messy yardwork boots.
I every day for dog walking in very muddy conditions for about  two hours, as well as hiking on all types of terrain.
I went with the 9 to make sure it wasnt too snug and Im glad I did, I think 8 1/2 would have been too small.
So I didn't have much time to find a pair of hiking boots prior to me going to a hike a 14er.
I'll try to break down my thoughts based off others' reviews that I read that convinced me to buy but also ones that made me a little nervous.Breaking in: With three days before the hike, I was extremely nervous this would give me issues.
I took it out to walk in a few miles a day to break them in but honestly, probably didn't need to.
They hardly needed breaking in and I am thankful for that.
"Rubbing on big toe" issue: I saw this come up on multiple reviews and it made me very nervous.
While I only noticed a bit of rubbing on my left foot, it wasn't painful and didn't take off any skin.
It was noticeable here and there but nothing major.
Since I was going on a big hike though, I did not want to take my chances and put a bit of moleskin there and was totally fine.Sizing: I read so many conflicting reviews about this but I ultimately decided to do a half size up.
We hiked for about 8 hours and they held up well!
Also-we were hiking for a very long time so I won't fault these boots too much for that!)
One little negative is that they seem to rub on one particular spot on both my ankles which causes a small blister.
Now I have swollen ankles because of thyroid issues so I'm guessing this the cause.
As for the water resistance I've yet to go for a walk in the rain so I cannot comment on that as yet.
In terms of style, they are pretty utilitarian but definitely not ugly.
Most importantly, they help me walk a lot farther without pain or injury.
Toca no basarce en el tallaje de la tabla, ped unas 8.5 basndome en la tabla de la descripcin y terminando siendo mucho ms grande, las 8.5 son de 25.5 cm
Get the right size and give yourself some time to break them in before you wear them for long walks or hikes.
Wide feet shoes are difficult to find for women so the products out there are few and expensive!
I usually wear a 9.5 runner but wanted to use these with winter socks.
No matter how tightly I tied the boots I couldn't not get to the point where I felt the ankle support was secure.
And going down hill in these boots is an experience.
I ordered the size I normally wear and maybe I needed half a size down.
My foot would slide all over the place while going at an incline it felt so unstable.
The tongue also likes to flip out no matter what technique I used to tie.
I previously had Timberland White Ledge mid boots and they felt so much sturdier.
It really just doesn't feel sturdy around my ankles.Pros - comfortable on flat paths, waterproof to an extent.
I had no issues when they got a bit wet from a shallow creek crossing.
As some other reviewers mentioned, there was a bit of a bump over the toe-box that had me worried about them.
I also tend to go anywhere from 5.5-6.5 shoe-wise, and erred towards the larger size originally, but 6.5 ended up being too large for me.
I could tell because even wearing my hiking socks, my feet would shift ever so slightly and I was more worried about that "bump" rubbing a sore into me.
After exchanging for a size 6, the bump was still there up until the end of the first day of breaking them in (the first day of my first snowy Tahoe trip.)
But by the next day, it was like the bump had melted away and since then these boots have been incredibly comfortable and supportive on my adventures!They showed their strength on my second Tahoe trip when we hoped to go snowshoeing, but there wasn't really enough snow to do that, so it ended up being a half-snow, half-mud hike through the snowshoeing trails.
I took off one star because they do hurt my ankles.
I expected this was likely since I don't normally wear high top shoes, so it's not a deal-breaker.
If I wore them a lot, they would no longer bruise me.
My husband and I (we are in our mid-50's) hiked several miles over about 3 days during our Fall color New York/Canada trip last month.
The terrain was wet and muddy but fairly flat.
I also wore them on the Hornblower, getting very close to Niagara Falls.
Once, the water washed up onto the boat deck and onto my feet, and I didn't even feel it!
I had sprayed my new boots with 2 coats of Scotchguard before the trip
But my feet never got close to being wet.About the big toe crease pain - I felt it immediately!
I wore them around the house for a couple of days before the trip, sticking moleskin to the top of my big toe where it hurt.
By the time I took my first hike, I no longer had any pain even without the moleskin and then in cotton socks!
Why?
That makes hiking boots hard to find, and I like Columbia brand, and didn't want to pay an outrageous price at an outdoors store to get them fitted to my feet.
I was really hoping these worked.Fortunately the weather was rather cold
I would definitely not wear these shoes in hot or warm weather, sad to say.
I've never submerged them in water fully but they tolerate rain and puddles well.
Was way too big and slipping at the back.
I was also extremely disappointed immediately upon opening, that they were obviously used.
The shoes had at least three areas of obvious white scuffs on them.
The box they came in was not the original Columbia box but an Amazon box.
The shoes were untied and did not have the paper inside them like a new pair would.
Shouldve said used/been priced appropriately cheaper Needless to say I returned them 5 minutes after receiving them.
I wear them probably 5 times a week and there are no soft spots on the soles, no thread tears/holes.
They still look fantastic.Over the course of 7 days, my husband and I walked 96 miles at Disney World.
I switched to these boots and, while I didn't win any beauty contest for wearing shorts and boots, I did save myself and my feet from a lot of pain!
my feet are usually very easily blistered, but even after a month of endless walking, I never once even had sore feet.
**I want to start off by saying that these are the first pair of hiking boots I've ever owned--so I have nothing to compare them to other than regular tennis shoes.
I wear padded hiking crew socks with these and there's enough room in the shoes without getting that "too tight" feeling.The first day I wore them, my ankles were sore and I nearly returned them but then I discovered that there are different lacing techniques to fix this problem, so I tried the Heel Lock technique and it completely fixed the problem.There was no break-in period, the shoes have been comfortable since day 1 and, as long as you are wearing the right socks, the back doesn't rub and blister the backs of your ankles.
They aren't the most comfortable shoes I own, but then again, I pretty much only wear Hokas.
I had really bad ankle instability, and these boots keep me on the straight and narrow while I hike on gravel.
I really do like them.
The soles are stiff enough to handle rocky trails but are not too stiff to walk on the sidewalk.
Unfortunately The boots were a little too narrow, a little too wide in the heel, and left my poor toes feeling squished.
I had a problem of my ankle twisting with most shoes, which I know is my own problem and this shoe 100% fixed it.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fit is a little weird above my ankle, even when its properly tightened.
My legs never feel like they were in a shoe after wearing them all day.Update:its been a really long time since I got these shoes, or maybe I hiked aloooooot.
Ive hiked several summits,water and really rough roads.
I prefer not putting the top hoop when I lace up and its still very sturdy on the legs.
I bought these just before a trip to Scotland - I was kicking myself for not breaking them in earlier, but they were totally fine despite the amount we hiked!!
Como fue un regalo la destinataria no lo va a cambiar.Por lo dems , parecen unas buenas botas a buen precio.
The boot is comfortable, not horribly heavy.
I wanted a boot I could use for work as well, I work at UPS, and I'm on my feet all day but did not want a bulky work boot.
size 10 is my typical size.I noticed some people had mentioned a bend in the toe box when you walk in them that is very uncomfortable and I noticed this too in the 10.5, whereas the 10 fit just right and leaves an eentsy bit of toe space for wide foot women like me.
Ive worn them to break them in, though they didnt really need it, and on one hike where they held up to the waterproof claim and the only sign of water was a cool sensation through the boot.
Overall Id say 4/5 because theyre not supremely comfortable and are sort of boxy.
I did lots of hiking and my feet did not hurt at all.
The boots are very lightweight, while looking a little bulky (I like this look).
On icy surfaces they are a little slippery.The boots look very nice and I can also wear them in the city without looking like I'm on a hike.
The boots fit me as expected (I wear 7.5 but I bought them in size 8 to be able to wear thicker socks in the winter).
With very thin socks I could wear a 7.
These boots protected me from cold and water in many hikes and vacations
I would repurchase them again when they'll be all used up and beaten up.
Tried these bad boys out for the first time today in order to give an honest review.
I hiked 2.9 miles through rocky and uneven terrain.
I wear them every day on the farm and would 100% purchase again.
Never had waterproof before and will probably never buy hiking boots without again.
Used for outside work at a nursery where was watering plants constantly and always kept feet dry.
I'm not sure if it's Amazon who sizes these or Columbia, but I have yet to meet a woman who couldn't agree that no matter what a woman wears, every brand fits differently.
Apparently we don't have a right to have a size to just find out and stick with across brands.
Well, buying on line it not woman friendly (normally, but more on that later).
One that I bought in my "usual" boot "size" going a half size up per instruction from the seller because of the insulator built inside the shoe.
Meanwhile, try finding a practical pair of shoes for a girl that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
Going with my standard 7 for average every day shoes, to a 7.5.
I found it annoying, but worthwhile to be able to find shoes that were actually useful for a woman, and not have to worry that I would be stuck a. with shoes that were the wrong size or b. paying shipping 3
It seems like a waste of recourses, was my only complaint.
This new pair is not a disappointment.
I don't slip on the rocks and I feel like my foot is supported.
The only thing we didn't go through was snow, because apparently even though we Californians were freezing our butts off already, the locals said the weather was actually great, and that the colder weather and storms were actually late this year xD.Anyways, these boots were extremely lightweight and required almost no breaking in.
I think it would definitely keep you dry, but remember only as far as the shoe goes will it keep you dry lol.
Im ordering a second pair in black to wear while working below the wing at the airport!
They fit as expected with my typical shoe size although you may want to add an insert if you have high arches like me.
I was hiking through puddles, mud, and rain and the insides stayed entirely dry!
My only problem is that it's a bit difficult to get the mud off the outside of the boots.
Pues hasta hoy estoy encantada, tengo un dolor en la cadera y me recomend su uso la ortopedista, las uso hasta para estar en casa pues me disminuye el dolor, me dijo que lo que hacen es lograr que se mantenga una postura correcta
The insole is very firm, but I took them on a long 30-minute walk to break them in before I hike with them and it turns out that the firmness is just right!
I have yet to use them to hike (for hours), so if I need to update this review, I will once I wear them in more challenging conditions.
These boots do not have the Columbia quality that I have come to expect.
They materials they are made from are quite cheap, the sole is not attractive and there are glue lines around the toe area.
At the time I was a bit desperate because I needed something to wear in the rain so I kept them.
Boots are comfortable and  I did not  get any blister.
They don't look like the leather I am used to like real heavy duty leather.
They look more like a leather blend since they are so light and thin.
I tried them on and they fit well but I don't feel any cushion at all -just feels like I am standing on a hard wood floor.
I felt like an astronaut wearing them but they provided the support and cushioning they claimed, although I couldn't really feel the cushion inside the boot there was no fatigue at all after a 5 mile hike.
Im 5ft 3 and 100lbs and Im always FREEZING.
Not once did my feet hurt, or get wet or get cold and we hiked for 4 hours!!
El precio me pareci muy bueno por la marca.
Generalmente soy talla 25.5 pero ped 26 y me quedaron muy bien (con espacio para los calcetines de lana que luego son muy gruesos).
Super steep inclines, rocky trails, muddy trails and slippery river rocks.Pros:Absolutely waterproof.
They will keep your feet nice and warm.Cons:A bit too sturdy.
Found myself with more than 5 blisters but I blame this on not breaking them in properly and using very bad socks.They sides started to "unstick" a bit.
It was comfortable to wear immediately and did not require a lengthy breaking in period.
My first pair was 5 years old but still waterproof and with plenty of tread, but I wanted another pair in case Columbia decided to stop making these.
After that they're ready to go.P.S.
I first bought a size larger than  I usually wear, a size12 for women  (I  usually have to buy a men's size) and I had a little  of  the  toe box pain that  many  reviews  complained  about, from the bend in the  upper shoe pressing on the big  toe.
No toe discomfort, and no chaffing so far.
And there  is  enough  room in  the  toe box for steep down hill hiking.
Im wearing them with compression socks as I am going on a long flight.
I will take them on a long walk And revise my review if theres any issues.
They fit well, they are sturdy but not so heavy, and the water resistance works well
They are a lot harder than I expected, basically no sole just feels like you're walking on hard plastic.
I bought the 10.5 and thick wool socks and this is working.I have not tested the waterproof component
cannot attest to that.
They do seem cooler than my last hiking boots but I've only used these with wool socks so that may have something to do with how comfortable they feel.
No complaints, would definitely buy these again!
I tried them on out of the box and wore them around the house for about 2 hours, then the next day took them on a 4 mile hike.
Even walking through thick mud twice, feet remained dry.
For reference, I am by no means a professional hiker, usually a max of 4-7 mile in a day.
No blisters or problems to speak of.
While I haven't tried total submersion, they successfully helped me cross several rivers (less than ankle deep) without any issue.
Fit is as expected.
Not overly comfortable and definitely NOT waterproof (see my wet socks after a walk in the wet grass - not even in the rain).
They are ok for this time of year but would be no good in the winter.
But there is basically no cushioning, which seems important in a hiking boot.
When I added padded insoles they were too tight against the top of my foot, so I returned them.
Broke these bad boys in by doing a 15 mile backpacking trip in thick mud!
They kept my feet warm, dry, and comfortable.
I was a bit worried about black being too hot since they have very little ventilation but I was super thankful for no mesh while trudging through the mud.
They're holding up well, but I wanted them in grey too.
Maybe it's years of wear, but i don't remember having to break in my first pair.
No need to break in.
When the upper of one of my beloved 2012 Newton Ridge boots separated from the sole I replaced them with 2019 Newton Ridge in pretty much the same color and I paid on ly $20 more.
I really can't complain since the old ones were closing in on 7 years old, had more than 1,000 miles on them, were worn as snow boots the first year and stored in my car's trunk most of the time.
I'm not a gung-ho type of hiker, I'm 60 years old, I live and hike in pretty flat terrain and I don't do any technical hikes any more.
I have a wide-ish flat foot, measure a 6.5 and normally order an 8 which is what I got in these new pair.
It has never fails me.
This shoes are super comfortable.
Shoes were firm not cushioned.
I walked through tall dried  grass & did not get one sticker stuck in my socks ? They also clean up well !
That is slightly disappointing.
While it did say it's water proof, I got caught in a torrential downpour hiking and my feet did not stay dry.
I wore them for a short hike (3 miles) through semi-rugged terrain and the shoes were durable but lightweight.
I like the boot, however the color (black) once worn the dust from the trails stick to the boot, causing it to look filthy even when brushed off.
years for work and after normal wear and tear I bought same exact pair.
I just was confused why they are dirty and I order them NEW, not used.
I am a newbie hiker and I didnt have to break them in.
I have worn Columbia brand boots for over 10 years and never had too many problems that I could not fix or workaround until I met this pair.
Long story, short...I now have Achilles tendonitis after wearing this boot and I am now in a medical stabilizing boot for the 6th month as a result.
Please wear something to protect your ankles when you wear these.
If youre a casual hiker these will last you a long time.
They are not just great for flying and all the hospitals we go to but they are amazing for all the scene calls out in the wilderness when we have to navigate through rough hiking conditions to get the the patient and then help carry them back or lug gear.
I really put these boots through the ringer and they stand up to the abuse.
These are really nice boots, however, buyer bewarethey are really narrow.
Por m, cero estrellas pues no s si el zapato es de mala o buena calidad como para calificarlos y para eso debo usarlos seguidos.
Pero para lo que los queria le doy 1 estrella que tampoco merecen: Los compr porque en una tienda me med unos y eran muy suaves y flexibles para el objetivo que los requiero, ms no tenan el color que que necesitaba.
Nada que ver con los que vi y me med en la tienda.
No more soggy, squishy feet
I have worn them on my winter hikes as well and my feet stayed warm even when snow got into the boots, and I had no slips.
Disclaimer: this was my first hike ever... I went a half size up taking into consideration the socks I was gonna wear.
My friends were concerned about me not trying them on prior to our 11 mile hike but tbh, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
it was 40 degrees out and my feet never felt cold either.
We walked through water and the boots proved to be waterproof.I know I have nothing to compare these shoes to but hey, for a first time hiker, I was super comfortable in them!
I did not break them in before leaving and they are probably the most comfortable boot I've ever owned straight out of the box.
I did feel like they ran a skosh large but I was wearing thick socks so I didn't mind that.
I didn't get blisters or have any discomfort at all and highly recommend.
I take a daily two mile walk around our farm.
I was getting tired of wet feet after a rain or heavy morning dew, so decided to try these.
I do not wear thick socks, so the size-up is not to accomodate such.
Despite heavy dew up to my ankles, the interior stays dry.
However I need a shoe with a wide toe box.While this shoe does not have as narrow a toe box as many shoes on the market , it definitely does not have a wide toe box as others have mentioned in prior reviews (this is directed to those people who have and understand this need).
I cannot wear a wide width in shoes because it is just too wide/big for the rest of my foot.I ended up getting a 10.5 in these shoes and wear double socks (balega socks) to try to get them to fit.My feet do move around a bit in the shoes while walking, but the shoe is sturdy enough, so far, that I am able to walk with enough support on day hikes over woodsy terrain- but would not use these for any major hiking over very rough terrain.ProsThey have proved to be waterproof while walking my dog/hiking in rainy, muddy and snowy weather.They have kept my feet warm (with the double balega socks) in 30 degree, snowy weather even though they are not insulatedThey are sturdy and the fit is somewhat adjustable with the lacing systemThey do 'break in' a bit to allow me to use them even though the fit is not perfectConsIt does not have a wide toe box.There was pain in one foot, in the toe box area, while breaking in the shoe and occasionally recurs during extended use.The ankle area on the left shoe does not fit well (even though the right foot fits fine) and has caused blisters and pain- I have added some padding to alleviate it.
I've worn them on warm days and they felt fine.
No toe crease issue, no foot pain!
They are attractive enough to wear in most settings.
Size 8 has enough room so that my toes don't slam against the front when trotting down hill.
They hold up to my wear and tear.
The sole isnt slippery and grips well.
My arches are neutral so I dont feel that anything is missing for me.They are pretty narrow - as someone said before, if your feet are on the wider side - take the wide size.
My feet at average width and these are snug.Shoe laces are a little stiff and are untying easily.
It is stiff when brand brand new so a break in period is due.
I feel like a mountain climbing chick when I wear them.
Comfortable, durable, and they are waterproof!
I stepped into a huge puddle and had to stand in it for a little while before I could step out of it - my feet were completely dry!
Bought these for my wife she loves them no complaints she walks every day no complaints
Do NOT go up a half size!
I have not gotten them wet yet, but I plan to wear them often!
I look forward to buying more in different colors!
Apenas llevo un mes con ellas pero espero que duren bastante
Never had that happen with a pair of hiking boots before.
I've worn them for several hikes and they didn't even need broken in.
I've tested the waterproofness and found it to be safe to walk through some boggy areas and puddles, not that I'd go wading in them.
I like that the soles are protective without being super thick and clunky, so you're still able to walk quietly through the woods.
We went through basically 3 season weather while doing that hike (snowy/icy winter, muddy spring, and dry/dusty summer) with these shoes on.I didn't have any issues with the fit, nothing chaffed on me and I have moderately wide feet.
I think the key is to wear proper socks to prevent blisters from forming and to also break them in before actually wearing them to go hiking.
I did slip a little on really icy patches but that is to be expected since these shoes don't have spikes that are specific for ice climbing.
Took these babies on a 6 mile hike, brand new, because I walked right through my last pair of hiking shoes and these babies were broken in within the first 2 hours.
I bought these boots for hiking and I am not disappointed.
I have not had any blisters when I started using them.
I have used them for over a month now hiking in wet and cold conditions, hiking steep mountains and woodlands, and they offered a great support for my feet and ankles no matter the terrain.
I have worn them for day hikes only (not for longer overnight hiking).
I wonder why I waited so long to get a good pair of hiking boots!
They are lightweight, comfy,  easy to clean, and kept my feet warm.
When we went to Machu Picchu it was super rainy and these shoes kept my feet warm as well as protected my feet from the endless puddles and from slipping on the steps.
When we got back to the hotel, yeah my socks got wet (i had no umbrella and wore the cheap ponchos they were selling,) and they managed to still keep my feet warm, ( these shoes dried pretty quickly compared to the rest of my family who just wore normal tennis shoes and had to wear plastic bags as socks since their shoes were completely soaked).
out of the whole family I was the only one wearing hiking boots and was told plenty of times about how I came prepared (Ive told them what they should bring but they brushed me off, I digress.
Note to self and others: break them in a little before attempting a 20 mile sojourn.
That being said these shoes made my stupidity not so unbearable.
They aren't too heavy which is nice.
These boots are so uncomfortable, I wore them for every day for months and they never got better.
Only 4 stars because I have not yet given them the test of time to see how long they will hold up.
Because of an allergy to plasticizers in rainboots, these poor things are getting super abuse on our farm.
I.E., wearing through the deep rains, barn slosh, and horse and goat manure while cleaning stalls in our continuous rains since the shoes arrived.
That is the one unknown and only reason I wouldn't give them 6 stars if I could.
I do wear socks, and can even wear a thicker sock if necessary.
After walking with them on another home, they didn't bother me anymore and keepy feet super dry and warm!
At the end of a shift, I've usually walked 8-9 miles.
I purchased these boots because with winter coming, I needed boots that would keep my feet warm, comfortable, and DRY.The boots fit true-to-size with enough room that you can wear thick socks if you need to, and still be comfortable.
The boots don't breathe very well, but since these will be fall/winter boots, that doesn't bother me too much since my feet are kept warm.
The waterproofing has been the most useful, as I work in all weather and sometimes our fields will flood after heavy rain.
Over the past few weeks of near-daily wear (and a few days of flooding), my feet are still dry!
You will not regret it!
I unfortunately didn't have a whole lot of time to break them in before my trip which is a huge no-no.Despite all that, I really loved these boots and so glad that I bought them.
My feet stayed dry and warm (along with the wool socks I wore) for the whole hike (about 4-5 hours) and they were also super comfy.
I wore them around for the remainder of the weekend too around Yosemite and didn't get any blisters or soreness at all.
I am disappointed that the blue columbia logo is missing from the back (as it was in other peoples reviews).
Conformed to my feet and even after an 8 mile hike 20k steps later my feet were not tired.
Just by securing it made all of the difference and I did not get any blisters this time.
All leather but light not heavy and cumbersome.
While stiff at first, these shoes became my favorite in no time!
I used them for roaming the outdoors, walking through streams, up rocky areas, and occasionally wore them to work.
They were even my go to for horse back riding.
They arrived today and I walked about, they are a taaad bit big so I can feel that "toe crease" others had complained about, but if I wear thick socks, I think I should be fine?
I do wish I ordered my normal size instead of sizing up.
The toe crease is annoying.
I did give these a try on a snowy hike in the Rockies and my feet stayed dry.
Bought these for my wife to walk the dog.
Theyre are comfortable straight out the box but a big minus which defeats the purpose of having these kind of boots is that theyre not waterproof, even just walking in wet grass.
I read all the reviews and honestly I was nervous about them not fitting my feet comfortably due to the toe box concerns.
But walked around in the house all day to give them a chance.They loosened up some, so I decided to keep them.Next day I went out with my Border Collie  on our daily hike.They broke in beautifully!
They arrived and after trying them on, I felt I had too much room to slide forward in the boot.
I read the reviews and knew this was common, so I ignored it and thought it was a step of breaking in the boot - no big deal.
The issue was descending on my hike - my feet kept slipping forward in the boots causing them to hit the edges of the toe box.
I still kept the boots because my test hike beat them up too much to return.
However, I have to wear three socks with them when I hike, in order to make them work.
However, I did replace the insloes that had no support what so ever.
I walked in water and mud and feet stayed dry.
I got them for the twice a day, 30-45 mins walks with my Labrador in my neighborhood, which is riddled with uneven sidewalks.
Unfortunately, these boots have ZERO arch support which is a huge problem for someone with high arches like me.
I developed so much pain at the top of my feet that I had to go see the orthopedist and he diagnosed extensor tendonitis - ouch!
I unfortunately ordered a half size up because I wear orthotics in all of my shoes.
But there is too much room in them still
These boots are very comfortable straight out of the box and aren't very heavy.
I can't comment on durability since i haven't had them for very long.
I also wear them on light hikes.
I had been using the grey ones for work for a year or so, but they got stolen off my porch when I put them out to dry in the sun.
They are still super comfortable, just a tad roomier than I might have liked.
These came to the top of my list based on reviews and my budget.
No "new shoe blues" at all, they were very comfortable all day.
The only negative so far is that they seemed minutely large... I normally wear 10 1/2-11, I ordered an 11 and only noticed the fit being slightly off when I was going downhill.
My toes hurt a bit, not too bad, and not something that I think thicker socks won't fix.
De media kon niet worden geladen.
but not so loose that they would rub.
They definitely needed to be worn in a bit, as they did bend in and press on my toes at first.
But, after that part softened, I could seriously wear them all day.
This is my second pair of Columbias and I like them better than any other hiking boot or shoe Ive tried.
even without the insoles the toe box is a little tight for me.
i work at the zoo so i have given these shoes some challenges.
I've walked through some shallow puddles and creeks but not deep enough to really tell how waterproof they are.
My only complaint about these is that it is difficult to tightly lace them all the way up through the ankle.
This doesn't bother me much but for someone looking for a high degree of ankle support you might run into some challenges.
I've had the boots about 2 weeks and I wear them most days.
First, they're super cute.
Hiked about 5-6 miles per day in them all summer and my feet did not hurt once.
Takes about a day to break in but theyre not painful.
Completely water and mud proof but they take a few days to dry if your foot is completely submerged (i.e. you jump in a pond with them on).
I wear them every day driving a school bus.
They are not heavy and I can drive in them.
My feet are never cold or wet with these boots.Cons: I have a high instep and the insole that came with them didn't work for me.
I replaced them with a different insole and they are now perfect.
Turn out it's too big.
This morning I went on my 2nd short hike in them, thinking to break them in, but Ive had no discomfort either time.I saw reviews about the bend in the toe area and the one time I wore these with thin, regular crew socks, I could see what they were talking about.
However, every time Ive worn them with appropriate wool socks (SmartWool is my preference), there has been no discomfort whatsoever.Im really happy with these and looking forward to bringing them on my adventures - and happy they dont weigh much too!
Shoes got here tuesday and i left for a camping trip wednesday.
my feet were dry and it was easy to clean the mud off the shoes.Im normally a 9 in shoes and a 10 in boots.
I broke them in by wearing them around the house and taking short walks before my trip, so that may have eliminated that issue.
These are sturdy and did not slip on rocks or even wet surfaces up and down the Georgia Mountains.
BUT don't forget to change the laces unless like me--you need lots of unexpected breaks to tie your shoes and catch your breath.
Not waterproof, but water resistant for a short time.
They these laces are not tightly wound and are fit more for tennis shoes.
After the first day they looked like I had had them for months based on the shoe strings.Other than that, the shoes themselves are great.Oh, also had to get inserts because absolutely no arch support in original ones.
With hiking shoes, shoes where we are going to be taking long walks, there should be support.
never more than a few mile easy hike with the occasional splashing in puddles.
As you can see in the video the outer layer is cracked and chipped, and now the shell has split creating a hole in the side.
These boots are trashed and I won't be purchasing Columbia boots again.
There are now cracks in the shoe which are progressively getting worst.
I wish I had returned these in the beginning rather than wait it out to see if they became more comfortable.
I went with Columbia since they're a well known brand.
Unfortunately these boots missed the mark on just about everything I needed.
I've had the same issue with the boot creasing uncomfortably over my toes.
I thought if I toughed it out they might break in and relieve this issues, but after almost 2 months of daily wear its still a problem.These boots seem to be waterproof as advertised, however, it doesnt matter as my feet sweat excessively in these boots.
This is not an issue with any of my other footwear.
Gross!While they have decent grip over rough terrain be cautious walking over any type of slippery surface, including smooth rocks or asphalt with the tiniest amount of water.
There's no grip in these conditions.The only plus to these boots is they are lightweight and have a comfortable sole.
My feet don't get fatigued by the end of the day.If I could I would return them, but I fear they are too worn and dirty from trying to break them in to be accepted back.
Perfect fit!I was nervous to order these without trying them on.
I did not experience any blisters or pinching or pain like I have with other hiking boots in the past.
I bought these bad boys and didn't have to break them in.
Normally I would have to use shoe trees on boots in the past to make sure they're stretched and comfortable enough to wear.
miles on these shoes before realizing that I had just bought them and I had no issues whatsoever.
miles on rough terrain, river water, mountains, desert, inclined slopes!
Not once did I have an issue with grip nor were my socks/feet wet.
The only thing I wish is that the insoles could be removed as I wear orthotics and makes them too tight
They were so comfortable to wear, even the first day!
You won't regret the price for comfort plus all of the call outs by the manufacturer
I usually like Columbia products and these shoes are no exception.
There was no break-in period necessary and they were lightweight and comfortable.
I was hiking in 95 degree weather, so with socks, they were too warm, but hiking was such a joy that I didn't notice.
I bought Columbia medium weight cotton socks, which were great with the boot.
I have never had a pair of boots that were so comfortable from day one.
If I has 1 complaint, it would be that theres no cushion in the bottom sole area.
Seem comfy, havent taken them on the trail yet but they seem promisingUpdate: I took a star off after my hiking trip.
Perhaps theyll wear in.
It was nothing major, just not a 5 star experience off the bat.
I chose the Brown ones (that's not the actual name of the color though).
I haven't used them a lot yet so I don't know how they will be in a wet environement or when they get more worne out.
This is my first pair of boots EVER- I'm a total sneaker head.
I know sneakers won't always cut it, especially if I want to start hiking more rugged trails.
I originally ordered a 9- but they squeezed my feet pretty bad.
I though I would have to wear them a few days to break them in for our camping trip, but I really don't!
They're not uncomfortable in the slightest.
At the end of the night, they were not sore and no blisters.
After I purchased them, I noticed a couple bad reviews.
I hiked 3 days straight up and down mountains, hiked the coast, walked around small towns with dirt roads.
I could not have asked for a better boot.
I went to Yosemite for the weekend to do some hiking for the very first time, and didn't have time to go to a store to try on boots.
I was pretty nervous ordering something that can make or break the experience online, especially with it arriving 1 day before I left.
We did a smaller hike (2 miles) on the first day, and there were no typical "breaking-in" issues.
After all that, my feet/knees didn't hurt at all.I've rolled my ankle like 100 times in my life and these boots were just the right height to protect me while hiking on crazy terrain filled with varying size rocks and massive roots.
My husband and I originally ordered a size up, but WAY too small...tried ordering larger, then larger sizes, but when they still didn't fit, we gave up and ordered different boots by a different company.
Able to fit fine with thin or thicker socks too.
Don't seem to have any toe problem after having it on and walking for 6hrs.
They fit well, they don't rub on any part of my foot to create blisters, I do recommend wearing high thicker socks though because they do slightly rub on the back of my ankle.
However, if you need a wider toe box these are not a good choice.
I have gone back to Keen's as I've had good luck with them in the past.
It wasn't terribly cold - maybe low 50's and WET -  but with one pair of socks my feet were warm and dry and no blisters!!
I've worn them briefly in colder weather and think they will be ok to about freezing temps.
I choose my true size and will say that with a thin sock they would fit big - but since I always intended to wear thicker socks - they are perfect.Oh - and they also look good and I wear them sometimes as just a pair of shoes with jeans.I've only had them a month though so cannot speak to durability.
Had over 15,000 steps in a day working in the yard and my feet didnt hurt!
I didnt want to waste money on bootsSTUPID!
My feet dont hurt.
My shoes dont smell like a thousand dirty gym socks after walking through water because these are waterproof.
These did not disappoint.
On the first full day I wore them they were comfortable but were only worn to walk around the city.
After a few hours of walking I did feel the need to fake the boots off as they felt heavy but that can be also due to the fact that Im 6 months pregnant and swollen after flying and being in high elevation.
Im a womens size 6 on most shoes, but I found these to be a smidge too big.
Now, I didn't expect them to last too long seeing as the description says they're only waterproof to some early morning dew and some showers, but I was so surprised to see that the shoes not only kept my feet perfectly dry but also warm.
They even had some grip on the more slippery and icy bits!Of course after a while the snow started to get into the shoes through the top and my feet started getting wet, BUT they still stayed considerably warm, considering the conditions!They were also such a light-weight and comfortable shoe that pushed me through all 8-9 miles of the hike, without needing to break them in.I cannot speak highly enough of these shoes, I can't wait to bring them to Costa Rica next month!
I have worn it hiking a couple times including very strenuous terrains with rockiness and was safe in these shoes!The soles are rough enough to prevent you from sliding in wet terrains, and my ankles were saved from snapping a couple of times on a recent hike.I recommend you combine these with hiking socks as I did get blisters on a recent hike.
I finally caved and bought real hiking shoes after always using athletic sneakers for hiking.
I really shouldn't have waited!!!
My shoes didn't need to be broken in and the traction was so much better than my new balance sneakers.
However you cannot step into a puddle which is higher than the lip.
They do not have a closed lip.
My first pair of real hiking boots and my feet didnt hurt at all!!
Also make sure to wear long socks with these shoes as they scraped the back of my ankles on my last hike.
I purchased these for an upcoming hiking trip, and after wearing them around the house I couldn't quite get the fit right.
I have narrow feet so it wasn't a width issue, but I ultimately decided it wouldn't break in like I wanted and returned them.
Been thru countless different types of boots for work.
My first pair was lost in transit and they immediately replaced them!!
outside are 18 degrees to 35 degrees, let me tell you, your feet get cold.
Hiking thru somewhat frozen rivers though, they did keep my feet dry.
I would buy them again but not for winter months.
I've had these for about 3 months so far now and they're still holding up.
I'm not exactly sure how waterproof they are anymore
my feet are sometimes a little wet but I can't tell if it's from water or sweat.
My feet are never actually soaked though unless I make the mistake of dumping water in my shoe.
But so far no tears or holes or anything like that!
Lite weight, support my feet, don't get too hot even in the SW Florida heat.
My mom goes for a hike every weekend and she really destroys  every pair of boots she wears.
I really cant think of anything to complain about, they did get wet and took a while to dry out but wouldnt be an issue if they dont get submerged.
Feet sometimes feel slightly some of the moisture though never wet .
I am comparing them to my Columbia snow boots that were 100% waterproof in snow and watery slush.
They're a little clunky looking around the ankle IMO, but look better than most other hiking boots.
They didn't need a lot of breaking in -- I wore them once on a short 2-mile hike in PA and then didn't wear them again until I went on a much longer hiking trip across the Southwest in autumn.
They felt lightweight and flexible.
No blisters, no discomfort.
I needed a new pair - well, actually, I've never had a pair of actual hiking shoes/boots, I've always just worn my tennis shoes (big mistake!)
Whew-you never know with teenagers.
Ordered my size (6) and half a size up (6.5) and ended up keeping the 6.
They were stiff and felt slightly tight at the beginning but I wore them every day to school for 2 weeks and they were ready to go.
The first 2 or 3 days I wore them they hurt where they bent at the crease, it almost made me return them, but I kept on wearing them and that went away.
If you are a serious hiker in need of real waterproof boots, these are not the ones for you.
These columbia boots started to fall apart by the end of my hike (15 miles, 4,000ft elevation) :(
After trying them for a short amount of time the boots seemed to stretch out more than Id like as my feet moved around a little too much and I couldnt get them to lace tight enough around my ankles.
The only thing is the arc support wasn't as good as she expected, but other than that everything else about the boots were great.
Normally I wear 9.5 shoes.
barely enough to wear gel insoles.
Not too heavy, size was perfect.
Im a size seven, borderline 7w.
Normally Im a 7.5 and I have wide feet so I buy boots in size 8 to account for extra movement space and thick socks.
For a snug fit, Id have to double up on my socks or wear really really thick socks.
I have only worn it once to Yosemite (after a storm passed) and the boots held up well and no wet socks!
Son super cmodas, resisten el agua siempre y cuando no se sumerjan ms all de donde comienzan los cordones y tienen muy buen agarre.
I desperately needed shoes that would prevent me from slipping and falling.
Ive walked through deep puddles and tons of mud and my feet have always stay dry.
While I haven't used these for the trip I bought them for, I am pleased that they fit true to size and I have plenty of toe room.
They look nice - more like a shoe than a boot and are fairly lightweight.
I don't want to be doing a lot of walking with heavy, clunky boots.
I was hesitant buying these at first, but man oh man did these shoes exceed my expectations.These are 100% waterproof, I went running through some deep water and not a drop got inside my shoes.Wore these while the humidity was high, my feet didn't sweat at all, despite the look these shoes keep all the cool air inside.Very comfortable to walk in, you would think these shoes look very stiff, nope not stiff at all, these are great for hiking.
I bought them in September of 2019 and Ive worn them on hundreds of hikes through all terrains including Utah dessert, and Colorado Rocky Mountains.
I wear them to work or to the store.the only negative I have for these Columbia Women's Newton Ridge Plus hiking boots is that the tongue does not stay or lay flat after a short time of walking, no matter how tight I tie the laces.I would recommend11.3.21 UPDATETHE TONGUE ON THESE BOOTS HURT MY FEET -- I HAVE WORN THEM LESS THAN A DOZEN TIMES - WILL BE THROWING THEM AWAY!!
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND OR SUGGEST THESE TO ANYONE -- ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO HIKES!
These boots are coming to me for Christmas, so I can't review them after a hike yet, but I did try them on.
I liked the fit, which was as expected, as well as the look and feel.
I didn't have the problem of them pinching my toes as other reviewers mentioned.
However, the only thing I notice is there is not much arch support.
They feel lightweight and I am probably going to to buy these in other colors!
They fit as expected.
I do have a bit of room in the toes, but they're very supportive at the ankle and comfortable, though they do feel a little weird as I'm breaking them in--where they fold at the top of the instep tends to pinch just a little.
Update:These have kept my feet dry in the rain.
My only complaint is that water can come in from the top of the shoe as you walk.
??-----------------Wore these yesterday without any breaking them in on a difficult hike.
It was raining at the start of the hike and they kept my feet dry.
They are a tad stiff but do the job well.
I have had compliments on them too.
I usually can't get my foot into hiking boots because of my arch and when I found a pair I could get on I couldn't wear my orthotics which, at the time,  I thought would not be a good thing.
I started walking with a walking stick because I felt so unstable.
When my ankle rolls continued and started getting worse I decided I needed a hiking boot.
Even though I don't use my orthotics I still cannot use all the eyelets over my instep but I can tighten the laces around my ankles.
I still step on things but my ankles feel sturdy now and do not roll over.
I have now given up on my orthotics and haven't regretted it YET.
The toe box is not as tall as the ariat boots and in these I can feel the top of the toe box grazing the top of my toes.
The toe pinch was a little uncomfortable but that was only for a few days until I broke them in.
Ive only experienced it once or twice and it was bad.
I dont recommend these for dry/hot climates.
I work at a flower farm and I hated my tennis shoes always getting soaked through these are so light weight its like tennis shoes but a water proof boot!!
Bought these for Yosemite in February and they made it over snow and ice without my clumsy self falling.
Blame it all on those roots that I put on these boots:)  I've put about 200 miles on these shoes in  the last month walking rustic trails as well as paved trails.
I wear a standard 8.5 in almost every shoe, but based on previous comments, I ordered a 9.
As first the ankles were stiff but after two long wears they fit like a glove.
They come waterproof so no need to spray protectant on them.
I wear them as a winter boot with wool socks and they keep my feet dry and warm on long walks.
I wear these in very light snow and heavy rain, and my feet remains warm and dry.
I've stepped in puddles of water, and my feet did not get wet.
I was also able to walk through a shallow river and no water in my boots at all!!
The only issue was when I walk there is a bend in the shoe pushes into my toes.
It only bothers me on my right foot, but I'm sure it's just because I haven't worn them in.
I didn't notice it too much anyway.
I have about an eight to a quarter inch wiggle room at the toe.
I will update my review once I wear them for a bit!
Won't work for hybrid work-play environments.I would recommend to a friend
Worn them several times in mud, extreme cold and kept my feet warm dry and comfortable!
I was thinking of ordering another pair to have when my current ones wear out.
We went on two major hikes, one which was 6 miles of rocky, uneven, steep uphill terrain and one which was 4 miles of muddy, snowy and wet terrain with few major inclines.
The one negative is that the laces kept coming untied and the ankles would become loose.
Otherwise, they kept out the cold and the water from the numerous large mud puddles and streams of water I walked through.
I didn't get a chance to break them in before our trip but they didn't cause any major pain.
Compared to other hiking boots you cannot beat the price.
I saw these at a local outdoor store but they didn't have my size, so I found them on Amazon.
They are slightly heavier than the trail runners I am used to, but not so bad (lighter than the last pair of real hiking boots I had).
I wore these boots on a 10 mile backpacking trip in Sequoia which lasted 2 days, and although they were a little uncomfortable because I was barely breaking them in they did the job.
The color of the boots was also a plus to me and there was just enough ankle support to help me from getting injured as well as enough grip to help me from slipping during difficult cliff areas.
Get 1/2 size larger if youre wearing these for work or hiking because a true fit will have the ball of your feet hurting because the metal shoestring loop will press on your foot and cause red, swollen feet and bunions in less than 2 days.
They are comfortable but I ordered my true size and started getting a bunion and the balls of my feet were numb for the entire week I wore them and then for 2 weeks after I stopped wearing them.
Its uncomfortable and didnt want to take the risk.
I wear a size 9 and my nikes tend to push on my toes but these did not even with thick socks.
I wore them for a week to break them in, then went hiking.
I haven't gone into the woods with them yet as I've been busy, but I'm sure they will serve their purpose.
I wore them for a day and they didn't rub in any spots and weren't tight.
One con--I do not like how the tags can be seen on both of the boot tongues.
She normally wears a 9-9.5 shoe.
She has not noticed the crease across the toe problem that other reviewers mentioned.
The tongue is padded mesh.)
My daughter doesn't have extremely high arches, but feels that the arch support is very good for normal arches.
Higher arches will probably need an insert.There is really nothing bad to say about these shoes.
I ordered a half a size up from my regular shoes size in case I ever hike in the cold and need to put on super thick socks,  but I could've ordered my regular size and been fine.
I stepped on a copperhead snake in these and didn't die, so naturally I convinced myself that they're lucky boots.
Haven't hiked in the rain in them though, so I can't comment on the waterproofness.
I'm not sure why anyone would hike in the rain anyway.
And I like that they are hard material I can wipe off and not cloth.
Everything was wet, the ground was very uneven and slippery but not for me with my new boots.
They do rub against the back of my feet after hours of hiking but it's not too bad.
I just need to know how to keep the shoestrings from coming loose.
Overall, I have gone on 5 hikes with this, strenuous hikes straight up hill and down hill and sometimes in the wet mud, and it holds well.
I had to get chains though for the slippery slopes as not to fall over ledges on hikes.
A bit stiff at first, of course, as they were new, but then bam!
My friend had other hiking shoes and she got huge blisters and lost 2 toenails, yikes!
I wore sock liners the whole trip, and didn't lace them super tight and they were a dream to hike in.
I didn't think about my feet once the whole time.
I cannot wait to take them out again.
I came back to re-examine the negative comments and can now see warnings everywhere.Even when sized correctly, the step crease in the top of the boot folds down and touches the top of my big toe, which first creates a painful blister, and then eventually rubs the skin off.
I've never had this issue with any other shoe or boot, but it seems like a common complaint for this boot.For me the problem WASN'T immediately evident upon trying the boot on -- it actually took a mile or two of hiking before the pain kicked in, and then it didn't stop.
Had to bump it up to two stars because these would have been perfect for me if not for the toe issue.
I wear a 6.5 and I decided to order a 7.
I ordered and 8 and it was a little too big.
Unfortunately I've had boots that did that before and that's not something that changes with use.
It normally gets worse so I had to return it .
They are great for a 5 mile hike anything more they can be uncomfortable but then again I was walking on mostly rock, so maybe that's what made them uncomfortable.
Personally after wearing these a bit in myNormal size, my feet slide around in them too much and they have no breathability.
They make a great jacket, but I guess not so much with boots.
They are not very padded on the inside at all, narrow down the sides.
Over all a cheap boot, had to send them back after trying them on.
The shoe is not comfortable at the ankle.
I was worried about some reviewers complaining about a problem with the boot rubbing on their upper toes.
I did notice that feeling for the first few wears but I wore thick socks and now that they are broken in I don't feel it at all.
I purchased this hiking boot for a hike in the enchantment trails in Seattle, a very hard and strenuous hike with rocky terrain.
they were truly waterproof, I accidentally stepped in a deep mud puddle and I had NOTHING seep into my shoe!
These boots are OK they are not particularly comfortable or uncomfortable and they seem to already have leaky spots in the waterproofing.
They do not have much cushioning and they are not insulated at all so my feet are hurting a little bit because there is no pattern to make up for the new shoe stiffness.
I am facility maintenance where I work and Im on my feet all day long.
These boots didnt have to be broken in and hold up really well!
I've worn them for more than a month now: through snow, icy slopes and staircases, caving, day hikes, and navigating wet aquatics facility floors.
I've never once gotten my feet wet trekking through snow or watery cave floors--in fact, I made the mistake of wearing these while trekking through knee-high water (they definitely kept the water in that time, oops).
After reading reviews, I did order a half size bigger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.
My feet stayed dry and comfortable - I couldn't ask for more.
UPDATE: I purchased the first pair in 2017 and Im only just now replacing in 2021.
I even sometimes wore them to work if I knew Id get muddy or wet or be on my feet all day.
I cannot recommend them enough.
I hike in some pretty rocky terrain and the tread is worn down substantially, but they are still completely  waterproof and supportive after 4 years of constant wear.
As others have mentioned, where the toe bends, the thickness of the boot creates a ridge that pushes on the top of your toes as you walk.
It isn't completely bothersome but enough to know it is there.
I used them for a long hike when I first got them, and I regretted it, they might be useful later but break them down first
I've worn them on a couple of moderate hikes and haven't had any problems.
I saw several reviews about the toe bend pinching your foot and making walking uncomfortable but I didn't experience that same problem.
I just received them and haven't gone hiking yet.
Only reason not 5 is I haven't taken on a long hike yet.
Old pair cracked where the toe bend/roll is and the sole started to come off.
Expected for a 4 year old boot I wore almost everyday to work and hike in.Great hiking boot with plenty enough grip to scale boulders and free climb a bit.
My arches tend to hurt without support.
I never had any foot pain for the entire 11 days!
I was nervous about what size to order as I wear an 8 1/2 for fashion shoes but my Asics sneakers are a size 9.
After reading the reviews I ordered the 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly!
I'm not having any of the issues stated in reviews about rubbing on the toe.
and my feet were dry as could be!
Reu rapidement j'ai march pendant 1 heure 30 minutes et les chaussures mes blesses le dessus des 2 grosse orteils j'espre qu'avec le temps le problme seras corrig.
I ordered a size up because I used them with thick socks for hiking in cold weather.
I hiked a total of 8 miles without breaking them in (I know, scary and dumb) and there was no issue.
For ankle support on rigourous hikes, the material they are made from is not as sturdy as other boots I have had.
(And I am unable to wear heels or anything fancy because of my damn disability and orthotics that I occasionally wear.)
Okay, taking my review rating down two counts ONLY because my left shoelace seems to be coming apart down at the second and third notches, yet I am dumbfounded as to how that is even happening??
*  Editing this because I need to toss in one major complaint here.
That, and it seems like the shoelaces are coming undone on their own free will intermittently throughout the day/evening.
Can't guarantee that every conversation on your hikes from now on won't be about the dang boots though...
the hike was very wet, a lot of creeks, crossing rocks over small streams and muddy paths- and my feet were completely warm and dry the entire time.
i wear a 6.5 shoe size and ordered it in these as well and they were fine.
You cannot even think of wearing a heavy sock with it.
Very disappointed and manufacturers need to stop making boots & shoes so small.
I hiked for 2 days straight in rocky and uneven terrain and they held up well.
I did not even have a chance to break them in before the hike.
Ive been searching for comfortable hiking boots for a while, these by far exceeded my expectations!
Not to mention actually cute and not bulky.
I would recommend a heavy duty waterproofing agent, especially where the "leather" meets the tongue of the boot otherwise they can get a bit damp.
Width was about average, seems very slightly more narrow in the heel ( good for me) and a bit flat in the foot box.
While snow shoeing my feet stayed pretty warm although a little damp because I was ankle deep in snow at points.Only con about them is theyre not super supportive so I may add some dr. Schols inserts to them.
These shoes did take a little breaking in for me (unlike some of the other reviewers) - but how many times do you actually not break a hiking shoe in before wearing it on a long hike?
When I first tried them on I was getting the pinching at the toe crease like some reviews claimed and I was really considering returning them but to my surprise it didn't last long and they became extremely comfortable.
Never once did these boots fail me.
I ordered two pairs of boots at the same time the other pair (not Columbia) was clunky and did not fit well at all this boot fit like it was made for me.
I only wore them a couple of times around the house for about 15 - 30 minutes before I went on my first hike with them.
Gave me lots of room around my toe area,  lightweight and feels comfy.
Haven't broken it in but just trying it around the house it's been great.
This was not the case at all.
One size was too small, so I returned it.
I got one blister on my toe, but even though I wore these boots to hike for 4-6 hours/day of hiking for the next week, the blister never even burst.Also literally half the cost of the same boot anywhere else.
I got my normal shoe size, and these boots fit PERFECTLY.
I didn't even try to break these in (although, to be honest--I have tough feet and work out every day
I didn't get one blister and my feet felt great, even being on them for about 6 hours.
Ordered an 8, fits like an 8.5 which is fine i just wear 2 pairs of socks.
Also no blisters or soreness on feet after each hike ive taken with them.
I loved these hiking boots, but as soon as I put them of i felt something uncomfortable on the right boot, my toes felt weird and missplaced, like a space between my toes and the front of the boot.
When I removed the insole as you see it has a manufacturer error, and a weird shape that I couldn't fix.
I was vey excited to used it but now I don't feel comfortable to go on long hikes since it can affect my toes.
Very disappointed
The only problem is they run a bit larger, and after walking on them 8
Didn't really need to break them in.
The laces do not look pink like in the picture.
I needed a shoe I could wear pretty much all the time and anywhere.
Unfortunately I found the shoe too large.
I wear a 7.5 and this was too big with thick socks.
I sent them back and am debating the size smaller or another boot altogether.
Over 5 days, all our feet remained completely dry.
miles) they're not all that comfortable, but that's to be expected.
I rarely wear shoes that hit at or above the ankle, so these will take some getting used to, but they did not seem to rub that much.
Again, I only wore them about 6 hours around the house, so I can't go by that alone, but I like them so far and they look rather nice, too.
I will try to update my review after my trip, but only if these shoes are not up to standards with my expectations.
These are the most comfortable pair of shoes Ive ever owned, that includes running, training, boots, etc., but the waterproof description is not quite accurate.
I wanted a pair of hikers that were waterproof for my regular 3mi treks.
Ive been hiking twice since I got them, and after walking through a cold creek, thankfully they kept my feet dry.
The only drawback Ive experienced is that the left shoe seems to rub the top inside of my foot for some reason making the shoe slightly uncomfortable.
Ive only worn them twice so far though and hoping that changes as I continue to break them in.
Walked for miles, for hours going up and down.
it rained a lot, etc, but my feet never hurt, I never slipped, and my feet were dry and confortable.
Never had to break them in.
Have used them for 6 weeks now and not one complaint.
I took these hiking after a nice rain and mud so thick you could slide down a hill.
I took off a star because I have the same problem another reviewer said about the toe part... when you walk the toe crease is weird, it rubs the top of my toes and it was uncomfortable, especially if you're walking on flat surface or hit any asphalt.
If I had to do it over again I would've ordered a size larger and worn really thick wool socks with these to help cushion against that weird crease.
I wouldn't buy again knowing this.
The only downfall is they are not even what we would consider water resistant.
These hiking boots are so comfortable, there's plenty of room for the toes to move (wide enough compared to my old pair which were too narrow and hurt my little toes after a long hike) and they're super lightweight.
We go hiking but have not yet.
Survived a pit bull mix puppy stealing them to chew on for about 20 minutes.
Weird
I went hiking to the Grand Canyon during winter time therefore there was some ice and lots of snow... these boots provided me with enough grip for the hike, great ankle stability!
but nothing too bad.
The fit is just a bit loose which is what I wanted so I can wear 2 pairs of socks or a pair of leg warmers as needed.
I've worn them to work/school already and they were so comfortable, no need to break them in at all.
Needed a boot that would hold up to 10 hour days in dirt, grass, mud and gravel.
An no las uso para alguna escalada pero se ve que van a funcionar bien.
I tried a day without them and it wasn't so great.
I just got them and haven't had a chance to really try them out except for around the house.
They are very comfortable, I don't have the issue about the top of the boot rubbing on my toes like some people do, I see how it comes down a little but it doesn't rub.
I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't had the chance to really try them out.
I wanted a new pair of hiking boots that were a little less chunky than my previous pair, yet offered good ankle support and durability.
I had a camping trip up to the high country of Yosemite, and these boots needed no break in time for the trip.
I hiked a few uphill trails with them, with no blisters!
They are waterproof too which was nice when crossing rivers.
(mt Monadnock and mt pierce) this shoe basically made her life confy and made through those two hikes (wet, muddy and rock scrambling) with no issue!
Had bought them for my daughter and ended up returning them as they were too large.
Was unable to replace them with a smaller size so ended up ordering a different style.
Usually wear a size 10, but got a 10.5.
The only break in needed is along the toe.
They did hurt the first time I wore them but after breaking them in I have had no issues.
However, winter for me is nothing like winter in other parts of the world, so take that with a grain of salt.All in all, these have been just what I needed.
No quera escribir una opinin hasta usarlas en el campo.Usualmente soy talla 9 americano (en los comentarios recomiendan pedir una talla ms, yo no lo hice) ped talla 9 y me quedaron bien, mi pie es delgado.Son muy ligeras, me lastimaron un poco pero es normal en la primera puesta.
Pude caminar sobre piedras muy inclinadas y no resbal.
While I dont feel like these shoes have as much arch support, that can be fixed by placing an insole.
Guess that is the trade off with a full leather boot.
I have had cactus spines go through the leather so its not impenetrable.These are ok, but would I buy them again?
Possibly, but I also might spring for a more expensive pair that didnt leave my wool socks so soaked that I leave wet spots on the tile after taking off my shoes!
Note:  I use my boots for regular hiking, I have not used them for "extreme hiking."
I am not sure if you would need more teeth grip on the sole for that.
The only way water can get into the boot is through the opening in the ankle (obviously).
I usually wear a size 8 1/2 but went a half size up so I could wear thick socks with them.
I also think these are cute boots too, not bulky but entirely practical.
La talla bien amplia aunque a m no me gener ningn problema, te da espacio para usar calcetas ms gruesas si eres muy fro lento.
These boots are a fairly stiff, not sure if that's just because they need to be worked in, but if I lace them up to fit snug I the metal hook parts hurt my ankles.
I've been doing them loser and they're more comfortable that way.
They seem to keep water out well but I've only worn them a few times.
Super excited about writing this review I took these bad boys on an intense hike two days after I bought them.
hrs and my feet were barely even sore, super comfortable, super cute definitely one of my favorite purchases
The toe box kept creasing on me and no matter how tight I tried to lace the boot, it would not stop.
Then I ordered a pair in 8, but then they were too tight!It was simply a case of my foot not cooperating.
until now.The only thing I would change would be the sole color.Would prefer a color closer to the rest of the boot so the whole boot looks one color and sleeker.I would color the sole if I thought it would work out - but I am sure it can't be done.Great boot at a great price.
I kept my normal size and even with socks...I had some room in the shoes but I rather them slightly bigger than too small.
If you plan to wear thick socks then a larger size may be necessary.
No blisters and protected my feet.
I work on a horse farm.
They are so comfortable and I have a bad ankle and it keeps it very stable.
The shoelaces started to loosen as the hike progressed tho which was a bit iriating as I didnt want to re-tie them.
I had on 2-pairs of socks as usual but they still seem a bit big.
I could probably go down a 1/2 size if they were available.
They're a bit stiff, but after a day of use they'll loosen up.
So if you have "kankles," i dont think youll favor these too much.
I used them on slippery snow pack and held up quite well as far as tread and kept the wet out.
So far, these boots have held up through a lot of rain and mud while hiking and have stayed comfortable throughout.
Not too bulky, but not so tight that Im unable to wear a hiking sock.
I was a little nervous to get these as the reviews I read were very mixed.
I did just that and have no problems so far.
You can still feel the top of the shoe on your toe, but nothing painful.
These are ugly looking boots in my opinion, but compared to the Timberland boots we ordered at the same time, these boots were a million times more comfortable.
Dear daughter did that, in fact, with no blisters or any problems.
Comfortable fit, and basically no breaking in time.
Pretty much wore them for a couple hours around the house, then the next day took them on a 5 mile moderate hike with decent sized ups and downs and my feet didnt hurt at all during the hike or after.
Most things I really like, fit, comfort, style, but the two sets of speed lacing hooks near the top are a huge problem for me.
I fell forward really hard on the gravel road and landed on my left knee, palms, and nose.
Fortunately, I did not break any bones.
I thought it was just a freak accident, but when I posted on my osteoporosis site, there were two others who said the same thing happened to them.
Lots of companies have gone to speed lacing hooks for the convenience factor, but I'd rather have eyelets for the safety factor.
I bought these for work and the boots did not disappoint!
These boots keep my feet completely dry all day even in heavy rain and puddles and when I inevitably spray myself with a hose!
The boots we delivered very quickly and I was able to break them in pretty well within the first week.
I bought an 11 and would have liked to get a 12 but it was going to cost twice as much.
I wear them everyday and I've noticed my feet are feeling much better than they used to after wearing my previous pair of hiking boots.
Day two of breaking them in, and they are already very comfortable!
And I also didn't have to size up, even though I'll be wearing thicker socks--that might vary for someone else, though.
It feels like I need to wear them more to break them in.
They were comfortable what keeps it from 5stars is  down hill my foot would slide to the front and it hurt my small toes after a while.
I ordered a size 6, my normal size, and it was way too roomy and didnt feel secure.
Surprising because Ive never been able to wear 5.5 in any kind of shoes before.
I wouldn't count on them for heavy duty hiking as the ankle support isn't great.
My feet got a little toasty in August here in the PNW, but not uncomfortably hot but enough that I noticed.
I bought these for my trip to Mendocino, realizing Ive been hiking in sneakers for too long now.
I didnt even have to break them in - no blisters and great support on first use.
Excellent for mud, brush and slippery surfaces.
I felt so at ease trekking the rough terrain.
The tongue also does not seem to be waterproof.
I'm going with Timberlands instead, which I have bought before and really like, though they are not as cute as these Columbias.
They were a bit large, I am usually a women's 11 but needed more like a 10.5 for this one.
They were good, though at keeping water out and were generally comfortable (even as a bit too large).
After 10 days of hiking through Iceland it wasn't until the 8th or 9th that my knees or feet started hurting (an issue I've had for a long time) which is really saying a lot, as usually they hurt after just a few hours or walking.
They definitely run a little big, I usually have to size up when I am planning on wearing thick socks but it worked with my usual 8.5!
9 was way too big.
In the add, it says Size fits as expected but they are too small.
I ordered these boots for a several weeks trek outside of the country.
I did not have time to try to break them in as I usually do with new boots, so I was a little worried at first.
My feet were thankful, no discomfort or rubbing in sensitive areas and the boots are lightweight.
It happened on the 7 which was a little big and again when I tried the 6.5 on at a store.
That size fit perfectly but the toe collapse was a no go.
Ordering shoes online has its cons.
I was nervous because apparently you are supposed to break in hiking boots before a big hike.
That was not the hiking boots fault for this toe gets blisters in all my hiking boots if Im going down hill a lot.
Just make sure you wear long socks to prevent your ankles from rubbing on the inside of the boot!
I wouldnt say they have intense tread, but much much better than your average gym shoe.
He hecho caminata de 10 kms y no cansan en lo absoluto.La mayora de los comentarios decan que eran true size pero vienen amplias.
They have weathered all four seasons, going through mud, snow, grass and over rocks, and they don't skip a beat.
I really needed some boots that wouldnt hurt after days on my feet and would be easy to clean if mud got on them.
I think charging more money for certain colors is ludicrous.
Plus they are indeed water proof (had no issues walking in small puddles/wet grass.
That's an 8 hour, 15 mile hike, with several thousand feet of elevation gain through stones, boulders, trees and slippery slabs of rock.
I was worried they might hurt my feet since I hadn't been able to "break" them first, but not only did they not hurt at all, but their grip kept me safe through some really slippery rock inclines.
The bed of the foot is wide enough for my wide/monkey feet, and remained waterproof even while stepping into the river for some water.
I thought I would need to break them in but they were ready to go out of the box.
Been hiking a few times in these.
I usually wear 8.5-9 and got a 9 and they fit great, roomy enough for thick socks if I need them.
They aren't too clunky either.
degrees so I wore low socks and it was a mistake, they rubbed my ankles pretty raw.
Have been on two hikes with them and NO complaints.
They did not need to be broken in either, which is a bonus.
The arch support is minimal, so I replaced the insoles with better ones.
The tan and red Columbia shoes I had been buying for years jumped $30, so I wanted to give these a shot.
I had to get a half size bigger than my normal shoe size.
Took only a day or two to break them in.
I spent the first half of the summer hiking in my tennis shoes and now after hiking in these boots, I can't believe how much time I wasted in the wrong shoes.
You don't pay as much for the logo.
The down side is it did give me blisters, but I believe it was my fault for not wearing a thicker socks since I did buy a half size bigger than my regular size.
I got these and I  really like them.
I had a trip coming up with LOTS of hiking and I wasn't liking anything I was finding in stores.
Breaking them in took maybe 1-2 days, it was easy and not painful.
Since then, I've worn them while hiking Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and Zion / Angel's Landing.
They are soft and comfortable, high enough so my shin does not hurt.
They are waterproof for sure, already checked that too.
I haven't hiked in them yet but I plan on it soon!!
After a 30 km hike, I they got to heavy and started to hurt on the ankles.
I have really thin ankles, so even though I tie them as tight as possible they started to feel uncomfortable after the 20 km.
Still like them, but would not recommend if you plan on using them for long hikes.
The rest of us wore ours on less strenuous hikes in the Rocky Mountains and Big Bend National Park.I wear a Women's 10/10.5 so I went with a 10.5 and I'm glad I did.
I wouldn't say that they run small, just that it's nice to be able to wear thick hiking socks.
Also, you may want to get an insole as there isn't tons of cushion/arch support.
I never had to break them in, I just put them on and went!
Ordered and then it got lost in shipping but I contacted Amazon and they sent another pair out immediately.
The front black rubber peeled off from the leather surface (~2 inches) during the 1st trip after  wearing about one week.
I never had to break them in as with my other boots as well by Columbia.
Put them on right out of the box and wore them all day with no problems at all.
I am overweight and with a previously broken foot.
I went to machu picchu, rainbow mountain, walked a lot for 10 consecutive days without any concern with this new boots.
These are actually waterproof and not just "kind of" waterproof.
I took a hike with a few somewhat challenging hills, and I didn't have any problems.
I am a beginner, so I don't need the most expensive and baddest boot out there, but I would like something comfortable as I decide if hiking is for me or not.
The box and the boot decline to identify what I consider that textured rubber look and smell - the description of the boot on Amazon says they are indeed leather, but I suspect they are not and will peel away.
Solo las he usado una semana y dan la impresin de tener mucho uso.
No leaks, completely waterproof.
I had no problem breaking them in and they did not cause any chafing, especially with thick socks.
I was worried about the dark brown being too dark but it looks lighter outside (and when covered in dirt!)
I did notice some creases around the toe area due to extra space as others mentioned as well, but this did not cause any functional problems.
I picked up the boot and it is lightweight.
I took my first step and what is that toe pinching pain!!!
Maybe if I march or walk without bending my toe, I attempted to walk/march/waddle from the living room to the kitchen and it was no use, the toe pinching feeling was horrible.
This is not the boot Ive been looking for.
Wear thick socks that are mid calf high, and you may prevent chafing at ankles.
The toe box doesnt feel tight, but trim toenails short to avoid poking holes in socks.
De media kon niet worden geladen.
My husband got a pair of the men's boots and we wore them for a 3 and a half mile hike through muddy slush and our feet stayed warm and dry.
The boots are lightweight and feel more like tennis shoes.
After reading some of the reviews, I ordered a half size larger than my regular shoe size and they fit perfectly with my gel insoles and wool socks.
I wear a 7 1/2 and the shoe feels too big.
I wish I would have gotten a size 7 instead.
No arch support in these for me.
No rubbing and good ankle support.
When I found out they were womens I never told him so it worked out.
I broke them in on a 10 mile hike (usually a bad idea) with no backup shoes and they were just fine.
Waterproof and sturdy, but definitely not warm winter boots.
I order hiking shoes a 1/2 size up so I can wear thick socks.
Not sure what the problem was with some reviews and the shoe cutting into the toes.
Not a problem for me.
Today is my first day to wear them and so far they are very comfortable.
This pair is a size 6 and fits perfectly.
I don't plan on doing a lot of hiking in them, I just wanted a good pair of boots.
Je conseil de les "casser" avant de les porter pour une longue expdition.
I wore them for the first time on a 5 mile hike and had minimal discomfort from what you would expect from breaking in a new pair of boots.
I am taking them hiking in a couple weeks for the first time so I will update on whether or not the toe buckled or I tripped because the shoelace caught the eye of the other boot?
They didn't need any break in for me.
I was a tad unsure about them as I have had problems with ankle height boots rubbing around the top.
these didn't bother me at all.
I live in a rainy climate and so they pass that test for me.
They are great for icy, cold, wet, winter days, I bought them one size larger so that I could wear them with a thick sock.
I need the padded sock because the shoe is not very soft.
I bought them for the Spring and Fall when I can't wear sneakers when I hike.
They keep my feet from getting muddy and wet.
They are a little stiff until they got worked in.
I could only wear them for about an hour to two hours before I needed to take them off but after a few wears they were so much better plus if you wear thicker socks that helps too.
I also walked two miles in the pouring rain and no water got in.
Needed to put shoe liners and wear heavy socks run big.
Soy de pie delgado y puedo llegar a ser 2.5 en zapatos y ped en 3.
Se ajustaron muy bien, son ligeros y excelentes para caminar.
I bought a suede pair that I just love, but wanted a pair to wear out and get dirty.
Also kept my feet dry in wet conditions.
The boots are very comfortable however after about 4 months the seams started conking undone.
Now there is a hold in the side from a seam coming undone and I cannot do anything about it because Ive had them so long.
This is the second pair I have had this problem with and the first one happened within the same amount of time.
I was worried about the toe pinching issue some people had, Ive had a lot of issues with toes in closed toe shoes.
No problems and didnt need to break in, wore straight to a pretty challenging  couple hour hike with no problems
They are lightweight enough to not be super hot in our hot weather but provide a good arch and ankle support for the uneven terrain.
I took these babies hiking and my feet did not hurt and they looked so cute on me.
Since then, I have been wearing them all day long with no pinching or binding.
Bought these a year ago and have worn them a lot.
I have tons of foot problems - bunions, no arches, arthritis in my toes and plantar fasciitis, so finding shoes that work is difficult.
I've also worn them for multiple longish hikes.
No need to break in.
I ordered a replacement pair in the grey and they were more problematic.
No sock change, no trail change, no foot change
it makes no sense!
The greys are uncomfortable and I have to use other ones to go the distances I'm used to.
These have made it up whiteface mountain and Greylock mountain with me in the dead of winter.
However, they lack insulation so I always wear wool socks.
Ive worn these on hikes in Utah and I have horrible blisters after 1 day under 10 miles of hiking.
I recently brought these on a backpacking trip in Virginia on a rainy day, and had to take them off after about 3 hours and switch to my barefoot shoes (which got soaked, but no blisters) after I started to feel my skin rubbing.
However, they were so cute she could actually where them while she is out and about.
The picture does not do them justice.
I did not need to break them in as they felt good right out of the box.
They are comfortable and not to heavy.
I did a 5 mile hike to break them in, and then did 8 miles the next day on the AT.
comfy but not too roomy.
I don't think half a size up is necessary at all.
I did not experience any severe bending or dips in the toe box area i'm grateful to say.
Now when I get home my feet are dry.
I had only ever hiked in running shoes and would get horrible, horrible blisters.
I was afraid because they seemed narrow with hiking liners and socks on -- but they're turning out to be very malleable shoes that break in well.
Took them all over Seattle Washington and Alaska.
Wear the right socks and you will have no problem.
I am not a serious hiker but these are super comfy to just wear as winter boots and are good for light hiking which what I have used for.
Boot runs a little big.
Pulled the trigger on these before a strenuous 12 mile hike.
Had only worn them twice on casual walks.
I have really bad feet and my feet lasted and I only got 1 small blister.
I had to add inserts for more arch support for my poor feet but love these!
However, it does not fit me at all.
It pinches at the toe pivot and hurts the top of my foot.
The pivot point is simply at the wrong place for me.
Ive gone hiking multiple times in them and they successfully withstand mud, water, and rough terrain.
So light I thought the package was empty when it arrived!
Can't wait to wear them on a hiking trip this weekend.
They feel like no breaking in will be required.
These shoes fit perfectly to size as my other shoes.
Fits larger than expected - I normally wear size 8.5 and the 8 is roomy especially around the toes.
I read a lot of reviews concerning comfort of theses babies, but I have had no issues!
Leaves me plenty of room to wear with wool socks when it's a bit colder, but I can also wear them with thinner socks without compromising a comfortable fit while hiking in warmer weather (which is all year round in Texas.)
Like that the inside material is not lined w fur.
Sprayed em w waterproof spray and water stays out.
After that it went downhill.
Ended up with awful blisters in the back of my feet.
My foot removed around in them a lot once they were a bit wet too.
Theyre fine if theyre dry- just try not to get them drenched or theyll become extremely uncomfortable.
We did a LOT of walking on that trip and I never had an issue with these.
I usually wear 7 or 71/2.
Got these on Thursday and hiked Mount Washington on Saturday and I have not one complaint about these shoes.
They were comfortable, offered support, and did not weigh me down.
I work in construction and was looking for a lightweight boot that would hold up to the mud and weather.
They are not extremely warm so make sure to wear the right socks in the winter.
I did wear them hiking after they were broken in and I got blisters on the tops of my toes, which I thought was weird.
Good for everyday work boots, not great for long hikes!
My feet were never too warm even though the hike was completely Un-shaded.
Have used it in the snow as well as on a hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back up.
Only complaint is the tongue constantly sticks out and wont stay in which results in rocks and gravel getting in pretty easily if Im not careful.
It also just looks weird.
I had purchased a pair of boots a while back and unfortunately went with my usual shoe size and they were just too tight.
They dont get too hot in warmer temperatures and didnt feel like they were weighing me down.
I wore them for a 3-4 hour hike for the first time, no blisters or any irritation.
I put in a cushier insole since the one that came with it was to thin.
However, after having worn them one year in only cold wet and winter weather on my daily 2 mile walks on my neighborhood sidewalks, the heel surface has worn off and worn clear through on the left heel.
However, the boots are not waterproof.
My socks didn't really get wet, but the inside of the boots were damp and had to dry overnight before being used again.
I wear a size 5.5 in shoes on average and got a 5.5 in these.
The only place that bothered my when "breaking in" in the shoes was the back which was stiff and dug into my ankle a bit (but that's really easy to soften).
We hiked and camped in temperatures ranging from 50-20deg F and these kept my kept my feet dry even after traipsing through mud and water.
It's got a good traction on the sole and the ankle support really helps.I wouldn't mind paying a little more for better arch support and overall sole comfort, but they aren't uncomfortable.Great hiking boots, great price.
These were delivered last week and I've walked about 50kms in them.
Im sad but I sent the back.
For not breaking in these boots before a 10 day hike with the national parks.
I've raved to numerous people about these boots and will be purchasing again when I wear these out!
They fit as expected and they lend my ankles the support they need.
I have worn them hiking a few times now and they make climbing up rocks, slopes, and uneven terrain much easier.
Looking forward to seeing how they hold up long term.
First time out ended up with a blister on my big toe where the boot flexes, after only about 4 miles.
Also the foot bed is not very resilient & needs lots of break in.
I was worried they would be too thin for my fat feet but they were good!
Lo que no me gusto es que se resbala, no son anti deslizantes.
Pedi una talla y media ms grande por que le que venia pequeo pero enrealidad creo que si ubiera pedido mi nmero me ubiera quedado mejor, muy buenos para realizar senderismo pero no los recomiendo para escalar ya que son botas y no son prcticos para pizar por caminos muy pequeos
I love the look of the hiking boots but,  every time I wear them to hike on the trails I have to stop to get small pebbles, leaves and other forrest stuff out of my boots.
pine needles etc.....how does this happen?
I got these to get me through the slippery, mucky bits of winter when a snow boot is too much.
I was worried about whether I should size up based on reviews.
I have had them a few months now and they are a bit smelly.
But I guess that's what happens when you sweat in a waterproof boot.
It is just not in stock.
I am not sure which.But I can find that it is offered on the company site.
It is very difficult for me to find a shoe that I am happy with.
Mainly b/c not all shoes are made the same.
but it is not offered.
my foot was overhanging the sole of the shoes, and it felt like my poor toes were in a vice.Now if I wore the shoes barefooted.
Im not sure if it had any ankle support, but I did hike up a gravel mountain that was almost 90 degrees up and I had no problems.
Make sure to air out the insides after a hike because it becomes moist.
The shoes is not soft and comfy.
I ordered a half size bigger and they are to big.
Ive have 3 pairs and never have had blisters or had to break them in.
When I read the reviews it says that these run small so i got a a size 10 a 9.5 would have been better, couldn't return because I started a new job yesterday and the boots were mandatory.
Replaced a pair of Ahnus that I returned because I didn't like that they Ahnus had plastic shoelace hooks.
I've been wearing them a lot over the past month and they're very lightweight and besides getting really dusty-looking, they don't show much sign of wear so far.
Extremely comfortable from the get-go, didn't require much breaking in, if at all.
I haven't been hiking in a long time and expected that I would end up with blisters and sore feet.
No blisters and and no sour feet.
I am a car saleswoman in upstate NY...and let me just say these boots truly are waterproof and they are super comfortable with the long hours I work and I do ALOT of walking.
I've worn these to go hiking a few times now and they are comfortable.
They've kept my feet dry when going through little streams which was nice!
They're a little hard to keep clean but that's to be expected I suppose.
These boots were exactly what I was expecting.
Wore them around a few days before to make sure they didn't hurt my feet.
They didn't so I wore them hiking all day for two days.
No pain.
Walked through water and mud and my feet never got wet.
Great for bad arches.
Never any blisters.
The first pair lasted 15 years and I still wear them although they look a bit tired.
By the end of a 30 40 minutes session of shoveling snow, my toes hurt from being in the cold.
However, after the first day she noticed the tongue on the right foot where it's folded created a hard lump which became very uncomfortable even slightly painful as she wore them one day two.
The tongue on the left foot is folded too but its soft, not this hard lump.
We'll be exchanging it and hopefully the replacement won't have this same issue.
Super rocky and never felt that my ankles were in danger.
I've done yardwork and local hikes to break them in, and they've proven to be exactly what I was looking for.They have strong ankle support, but if you expect the cinch them down across the bridge of your foot, you might be disappointed.I don't tightlace, though, so it's not a problem for me.
These were very well constructed but were too stiff across toes (where seam for where the laces are is sewn to the top of the boot).
They were also smelly, like a musty/mildewed odor.
So, I had to return them.
The other colors in this style of Columbia boots are not made of the same material and do not hurt the top of my foot like the black ones.
Took me about a month of wear to break them in before they were comfortable (at first they were giving me terrible blisters on my left big toe where they would bend when I walked).
I actually tried this shoe three separate times, thinking that the fit was just off or something because I wanted them to work so bad.
If there's any motion at all, these make my feet sweat so badly its uncomfortable.
I can't stay in them longer than 10 minutes.
I even tried sizing down, thinking maybe the extra room was causing too much friction.
I have no idea what's up with these, but I'm so sad because they look so good.
I walked though water, dirt, mud and these shoes held on.
I have weak ankles and these boots stabilized my ankles and kept me from twisting them
This is the only issue I've noticed, and the only one I've read about.
I tried to reach out to Columbia's customer service via their website about this issue, but the site was glitched and wasn't allowing me contact them.
I'm still deciding whether I should return them, or suffer through them considering they were only $46 on Amazon.
I really want them to work-- I want to like them!
Comodisimas y cumplen perfectamente su funcion, no les ha pasado nada a casi un ao de que las compre.
They are so lightweight.
Went hiking without wearing them much before I went and didnt have any problems.
I love Columbia Sport products and wanted a waterproof boot for my long walks in the rain but this boot is NOT Waterproof.
I was simply walking outside under a moderate rain fall the other day and within half an hour my socks were wet and cold.
These boots are also not at all comfotable.
There is not much support or cushioning and my feet ached the whole time.
I am extremely disappointed in these boots and how they are described on the Columbia and Amazon website.
False claims are not how you retain loyal customers.
Didn't break them in before wearing, and they ended up being used all 3 days and I didn't get any blisters :)
There were no breaking them in.
I did order a 1/2 size larger so that I can wear thicker socks.
Loved the color they were easy to wash the dirt off.
Not too heavy.
Theyve seriously been my favorite hiking boots so far.
Mine have been put through some major work and still have no tears, holes, or defects.
Havent worn them yet cause they are for the winter for me.
Ive worn these boots on about 6-7 hikes with hiking socks.
however, I brought them to hike in Alaska and wasnt impressed.
I am not sure how well they will hold up.
I have slim feet and they are always cold.
I forgot to break them in until the night before so just wore them for 30 minutes around the house and then up the mountain the next morning.
The toe box definitely felt a little wacky when I first put them on but that went away in a few minutes.
Comfortbale, great support, decent grip, and they match anything I wear!
However, they're a bit heavy/clunky, which makes breaking them in more painful in my opinion (got some rough blisters on the first 3
mile hike I did in them) and makes rougher terrain a little tough.
Perfect for trails if only they were more flexible.If you can spend a little more for Merrells, I suggest you do.
Im unfortunately stuck with these....for now.
These are possibly the only pair of shoes I have worn that NEVER gave me any blisters.
They are super comfortable and have just the right amount of support while hiking.
I ordered a size 7 of this product and typically wear a size 7.
No areas pinch or are tight.
However, despite reviews of them being comfortable without even breaking them in before use are false.
The bend in the shoe when you walk rubbed off the skin on my toes despite wearing thick socks.
The only issue  was inconsistent sizing.
But with a free delivery it wasnt much of the problem.
Wore them for 5 days straight and didnt get a blister or have foot pain!
I didn't buy them because they were a little over my budget.
I will be able to wear these all day with no problem.
Cheap looking.
No del todo... Lstima despus de cierta distancia.
Lo que no me agrad, antes de recibir el articulo lo cancel porque en mi pas era ms barato.
I really like the how the laces don't have to be threaded through holes and instead are held by brackets going up the ankle, it makes it far easier to take the boots on and off compared to the traditional kind.
Also, they are lightweight, and when I walked through the rain in them for a 7 mile hike my feet stayed dry as can be.
Since I use a wheelchair and don't actually walk on them, I didn't realize.
I have a difficult foot to fit and have a hard time finding boots and shoes.
I did have a little blister after the first use but probably wore them too long on the first outing.
Just had 1 day to brake them in... these boots outperformed!!!
They were comfortable from first wear and didnt need to be broken in.
I wear them with a medium weight sock, ordered size I wear.
I now look forward to hiking Hurricane Ridge with nary a blister or friction rub.
True to fit, but also enough room to wear your thick winter socks.
I just didn't like the way the material was so stiff...maybe it gets better after breaking them in but that would be painful in these.
You will not be disappointed
These boots were perfect for my sequoia national park trip, it was cold and snowing and my feet were nice and warm.
Also I have flat feet and these boots gave me the comfort and foot support I need it for those long hiking walks.
The colour is red and not hot pink as I thought it was from the picture.
Not too heavy to wear to run errands.
I was concerned they might be too bulky but compared to my steel toe boots that I wear less frequently for work these are weightless and small.
However they will not be great for city walking on sidewalks.
They feel much more appropriate for messy work or walking on rough terrain.
We had to cross a few streams throughout the trip and I was pleasantly surprised by how dry my feet stayed.
First impression: very light weight, thin feeling material, uninsulated (probably will be good for summer weather), sleek look (not bulky), dont feel substantial (but Im used to a more rugged boot), not much arch support (I wear Spenco Arch Supports in nearly all my shoes), very disappointed to notice the cute contrasting logo is missing from the heel of the boot (I really liked that pop of color, it was advertised in the photographs, not sure why its not there), walking in the house boots are comfortable (with my arch supports added), they feel super light weight, I will try thicker socks for warmth before deciding to keep them.
However after wearing for several hikes, I consistently got blisters under my toes.
I switched to a brand with more padding and have had no issues.
Because I got a 8 and it was too big.
I could not recommend these hiking boots enough!
I bought them for Machu Picchu and rainbow mountain with very little time to break them in before the hikes, I had zero issues with blisters or sore feet.
I wore them through snow, mud and streams and they kept my feet warm and dry.
Ive noticed that some Columbia hiking boots (at least womens) are rather narrow.
I ordered them to wear with my work uniform since I'm required to wear brown leather boots.
The sole is already coming off.
Very disappointing since they fit me well, are light weight, and gave me no discomfort when hiking.
Having a hiking boot with a sole coming off after 5 months of normal wear is just not acceptable.
Unfortunately Ill be returning these.
I hiked all day (12 miles) in southern Utah in these without getting any blisters until the last mile, which is pretty great for not breaking them in beforehand!
I didn't get any toe crease or pinching.
I was hiking/running up and down rocks all day and didn't slip once.
I haven't tried them on a muddy/wet trail yet or in the cold but I'm hoping they'll hold up.
You do not have to go through the break your new boots in process.
Durable as well, I wear them on the construction jobsite at work, in all type of conditions.
I like the different color options that are available now too.
I wore them on a long 2.5 day hike on the Appalachian trail in the cold going through water and mud.
I normally wear a size 6.5 and bought a 7.5 because of other reviews.
Thinner socks would not work as well, but I'm planning on putting an insole if I wear thin socks.
Truth be told, they do need to be broken in.
I was wrong.
I've worn them on packed snow and they offer great traction.
They are most comfortable with socks that are crew cut (come up to about mid-shin), but they worked decently with ankle socks too (I just wouldn't hike in them wearing ankle socks).
I've worn them for 10 hours straight with no change in comfort level and I just got them a couple days ago.
Columbia's do run a little big in my opinion.
I normally wear a 7 in almost all women's brand shoes but this is my 2d pair of Columbia's and I've had to go down half a size or 1 full size.
Waterproof keeps you dry.
After some significant mud exposure they cleaned up to look like new.
There is a small amount of creasing that happens at the ball of the foot, but I found that after breaking them in, I no longer feel it at all.
Durable and never felt water come in.
They were supposed to just be for our family nature walks but I ended up loving them so much I just wear them whenever I feel like it!
They're a little stiff though (they started to break in better after I hiked at least 10 miles in them), so I've had to double up on socks to make sure I don't get any blisters on my toes.
I hve hammertoes on my right foot and, once broken in, the boots leather siftened enkigh to sccomofate them better than as well as can be expected.
Love the boots as a dog groomer I get wet all day & they help keep my feet dry: great boot
Also, I did encounter a fair amount of mud and water on my short hike and they do seem to be waterproof as advertised.
They are completely waterproof and no blisters after the first hike.
however, they are extremely comfortable once worn in.
I bought these hikers because they were considerably less expensive than Keens or Merrills that I usually purchase.
However, they do not fit as supportive as a more expensive hiker and I feel no arch support.
They flex right across the top of my toes and theres no padding so its a bit uncomfortable.
Ive been on a few small hikes in them so far and without the arch support and padding my feel fatigued very quickly.
I guess $80 buys a mediocre shoe these days.
I also have pretty bad bunions on both my feet and these shoes didn't seem to bother them!
I love these boots but quite disappointed because they run too small.
I purchased these over the summer knowing I would need something for the cold weather.
I didn't realize they run so small, I even bought a larger size and now that it's cold, I have discovered that I can't even wear them.
Since I bought them over the summer and I wore them once, I can no longer return them and don't know what to do with them.
I haven't actually worn them yet but I just wanted to report that they fit as expected.
I went for a 9 hour hike the first time I wore them and didn't get any blisters.
i have not tried it for hiking yet.
Buen calzado, cmodos, bonitos y muy duradero.
I want to order a second pair for when I wear these out.
The laces are a bit short making the fit awkward.
I expected more mesh and a lighter boot.
I hike at least 30 miles a week and Columbia boots typically last 9 months to a year.
Received today and immediately put on to wear and assess before hiking.
These boots are super comfy and super durable and super cute!
I wear a size 10 by the way and the fit was fine.
These shoes are okay, I don't like how they seem to look cheap for some reason.
They're much more stiff than other leather hiking boots I've used straight out of the box.
But honestly, considering the price is cheaper than the expensive brands of hiking boots, you can't really complain.
I have wide feet and was skeptical about the fit being to snug but toes has room without feeling loose.
I have very very wide feet so they are obviously a little narrow and I start to get uncomfortable after a few hours, but if you have average or a little bit wide feet I would think you probably wouldn't have an issue with that.
They felt a little snug but increasing felt tighter as the day went on and gave me blisters.
I had to wear them in a bit.
I wore them for a 6 hour climb with very little breaking in and didn't get any blisters.
I'd call this a "stock" boot.
Nothing special, no extra cushioning or support.
As others have written, toe box is a bit oversized.
Ordered that size first and they felt too snug to wear with wool socks.
Sized up to an 11 and they're a bit too loose, I got hot spots on my big toes from rubbing as others have written.
I dont think size or sock type was the issue, I have ordered six pairs of hiking boots to try on, and none are so painful.
The first area it seems to ware down at is the rubber at the top of the toe.
I had to return mine because the size was not only smaller than it advertised (both here on Amazon and their official website), but extremely narrow.
They've been out of stock since, and resellers have them up at around $150.
So due to their lack of proper guides, they've lost a customer.Lastly, to note, I typically wear a size 7 (I'm smaller, but I like my boots a bit roomer to accommodate socks) and the Colombia size 7 felt like a very narrow 5.
Be warned, and be careful, when selecting your size.
I hated these boots for a while and even considered sending them back.
They felt too tight, the arch felt weird.
I do suffer from heel pain.
Fit was snugger on my foot but at least my feet didn't hurt at the end of the day.
No, I don't sit all day.
They aren't insulated so would need thicker socks to help keep feet warm.
I normally wear compression socks.
I have had these just over a year and have finally worn them out.
Just wish they would have lasted a little longer.
Did not have any problems with the waterproofing until the seam split between the upper and the sole.
Walked through mud and water and almost every other terrain and they were fine.
Lightweight enough for warmer weather and tough enough for winter.
just have to break them in a little.
I walked through lots of mud with ease, also had great traction when u was going up and down hill on the trail.
Perhaps I have small heals, they are a bit loose.
Maybe this would break in, but I decided that for the price of the boots, it was not worth risking that I would feel that at every step.
They seem to run a little large - maybe a half size down would solve the problem... but now the price on Amazon has gone up $15 from when I first bought them.
Walked through mud and streams and my feet stayed dry and comfortable.
Esta algo pequeo para la talla que Ped, aunque esta sper bueno el zapato gran calidad.
True to size, plenty of toe box room.Bought them for hiking, and first time out proved very comfortable.
I bought these boots for their waterproof feature unfortunately the rubber on the toe is already separating.
It supports my weak ankle
I tried to save a few dollars and it's just not worth it.
Sturdy yet lightweight and good in the snow as well.
I ordered up 1/2 size because like to wear very heavy boot socks.
These are not too narrow nor too wide.
Lightweight not bulky looking.
On another, flat trail I tripped because my tied lace loop got caught in one of the hooks - totally my fault though, cannot blame the design.
Just be aware, don't be lazy lol.
Took a few wears to break in and I always wear them with two pairs of socks.
These are my mountain boots and I wear them every time I go to my cabin (which is almost every weekend).
They are still fairly new and the longest hike I have worn them on was 3 miles, I do think they would remain comfortable on longer hikes as well.
The only time they are uncomfortable is when I drive with them on, they cut into the back of my ankles.
I got these just in time for my hiking trip, so I didn't have time to break them in beforehand.
Thankfully I have my own inserts, because the ones provided are not padded at all.
Overall, I really like these boots and in the very little I tested them the waterproof seems to work.
For the price, didnt seem like a bad boot.
The thing that caused me not to keep these was the toe.
Only took a few steps around my apartment to imagine how painful that would be after even half a mile.
Maybe it would get better with wear, but I wasnt willing to try it out.
The shoe itself is waterproof however the middle tongue of the shoe is not.
Unfortunately I purchased the boot for the waterproof quality.
They are just not waterproof as the description alludes too!!
This causes the one boot to be too tight!
I'm trying to figure out how to get those replaced....*UPDATE* Amazon promptly overnighted a new pair of boots.
I try them on, remove the laces just to make sure they're good, and lo and behold, the same problem!
Quality control at Columbia must be off a bit....I just switched out one of the shorter laces with the longer one on the new pair to fix my problem...but beware of this!
I love to hike but I have weak ankles.
I have sprained them many times over the years wearing the wrong shoes.
I bought these because I was traveling to Georgia (the country not the state).
I hiked through the snow in these and my feet felt supported and never got wet.
Ill try to break them in but I might have to replace them with bigger size!
I have not regretted the decision!
I got them a half size up so that I could wear thick socks.
They are waterproof, sturdy, and the crease doesn't touch my toes, so I wouldn't even notice it if I hadn
Not to mention they have awesome support, even being fairly new and not broken in yet, my feet didnt hurt.
They are waterproof and I was able to hike and walk in shallow puddles without getting wet.
I wore them a few times to break them in and the pinch wasnt too bad.
However the first 10 mile hike in them, the toe pinch increased to the point of blisters.
My hike turned miserable and painful.
De media kon niet worden geladen.
Kept my feet dry on multiple muddy trucks.
I didn't have to break them in at all.
Son ligeras, cmodas, resistentes, pero siento que me quedan un poquitito grandes, no afecta si los ajusto muy bien
Most boots you put your feet in you can't wear them all day but these are by far the best pair I had in a while!!!
I sized up so they were a little big.
The only issue I have is that on my left boot the fold from the tongue digs into my foot making it uncomfortable and mildly painful.
I'm hoping through wear the left boot eventually softens up.
These boots were comfortable, little cold during a day in the snow, but over all they were great boots
I did buy a half size up in order to accommodate my shoe inserts and wool socks, but I left my trip with not a blister or raw spot in sight.
They didn't even really need broken in
They feel secure on your feet, and they have a nice, thick sole so your feet don't get too sore from walking on uneven terrain.
Came fast too.
Super comfortable and no need for breaking in!
Waterproof through the puddles of mud we went through trying to get to the lookouts.
Probably annoyed our friends by talking so much about them and about how I never would have survived the trip without them!
It doesn't squeeze the feet but also isn't too roomy.
I had only broken them in by mowing the lawn in them, and one ten mile hike prior to the big trip.
I wore them for 8-11 miles every day on rough terrain for five days and had zero hot spots or blisters.The only issue is that they are slippery on wet rocks.
I ordered these for my 14 year old daughter who will be using them on a camping trip this weekend with her JROTC class.
From the start, they were already the most comfortable boot I have worn.
Couldn't have done it without these boots.
Not only are they waterproof, but I found these to be MORE comfortable than my sneakers and doc Martins.
Seriously, I cannot wait for spring to go hiking in them!
Me gustaron, buen soporte, muy cmodas y de muy alta calidad.
I haven't yet tested the waterproofing abilities but I will update if there are issues.
Feet did not hurt or blister even though lots of hiking rough country and no break in prior to first use
I bought both these and a pair of keens to test out indoors.
I figure if I was already feeling that crease in just a few minutes that I didnt want to deal with that 20 miles in on a trip.
I wanted to like these but I couldn't!
No rubbing or sore spots.
Stayed dry and had no slips or falls.
Cant believe I got these for such a low price.
I've been wanting to invest in hiking boots for quite some time but the ones I had been looking at were all over $150.
Couldn't be happier with my purchase & they were comfortable from the moment I put them on through out the whole hike.
I normal wear 8.5-9 depending and I bout an 8.5 and they have enough room for thick socks and are comfortable with thin socks too.I did my research on a lot of boots and this by far stole the show.
Aunque los zapatos son cmodos y bonitos, los cordones no son de la mejor calidad y ya empiezan a romperse con dos meses de uso.
So comfy and looks super cute.
I had an accident and they save my foot.Little scars in body, but foot, anyyyyy.
They are light, not warm, breatheable and confortable.With water, no protect so much.
Las amo, el pequeo problema es que no soportan las fuertes lluvias de mi pas, se que no son botas para lluvia, pero deberan proteger un poco ms.
Don't have worry about ripping fabric or whatever.When it rains your feet are warm and dry.
Bought these boots for a hiking trip and my feet were comfortable and dry despite muddy and rainy trails.
I work outside, nothing crazy or abnormal, and my feet are damp.
Arrived one day before expected.
Haven't taken these on a good hike yet but they appear to be a nice lightweight hiking shoe
Hiked all over Iceland on rocky terrain, muddy terrain, slippery terrain, glaciers and the boots held up well.
Feet never got wet.
I did not end up keeping them because they were a bit too lightweight for what I was wanting.
I think they would be a great light hiker in a temperate climate, but not sure they'd be that warm in snow or very cold weather.
Nothing hurt.
I sized 1/2 size up to account for my foot swelling in long distance hikes.
No complaints.
Bought these just before a camping trip and was glad I did -- i tested these in muddy, messy hiking conditions and they protected my feet and ankles from slips and slides.
Okay, maybe it's just the way they fit my feet fit in the shoe or something - they've got amazing grip, they seem to be long-lasting, they're cute, but they DESTROYED my left heel coming back from an 8mi hike.
They are not completely waterproof, but do a really good job of keeping water out.
I have walked many many kilometers in these and they are always comfortable.
I have also hiked in hot areas with thin socks and my feet were never too warm.
The boots were advertised like new, but I bet they were never worn.
Broke it very quickly.
Its comfortable and rendered more support to my ankles and knees.
I needed insoles because there wasn't any arch support and my feet were cramping up on long hikes.
Having never worn a mid-rise hiking boot or shoe...  I am getting used to the high sides and little lower back rubbing on my ankles.
My regular snow boots are too bulky, and my walking shoes/sneakers are not warm enough for Upstate NY winters.
I do think that if temps drop significantly, I will need warmer socks, but the boots are great.
Only complaint is the right boot started to cut into my ankle a little, requiring a sock/pant adjustment and to loosen the boot.
We forded streams and all sorts of rough terrain without any issue in these - great grip and pretty waterproof from what I experienced.
I didn't need to break these in as they fit well from straight out of the box.
Could use more arch support.
Feet didn't get wet in the rain.
Haven't done a long hike yet, but wore them all day at work a couple days to break them in.
The boots are a little big although they are a 7 which is my size.
It's really stiff & clunky if you plan to walk on cement/ asphalt
I couldn't even get my foot in these.
Comfortable around the ankles, no painful break-in period after I started wearing them.
Colour is neutral so can match many items of clothing and it can be dressed up or down.Price was attractive too.
I sized up based off reviews and I'm glad I did because if I hadn't I think they would've been a little too snug .
Not stiff, very comfortable.
Quality has gone down hill.
One of them seems to making a clopping sound cant ever figure which one no matter how I tie my laces.
Maybe I walk wrong.
Haven't gone on a long time yet but so far I love them.
Have walked around in them to help break them in and had no issues so far.
UPDATE: these made it all the way through my geology field camp and were great.
After experiencing some problems with other brands, I ordered a larger size.
This is not necessary, as these seem to run true to size.
However, they do have a weird break across the two box that I didn't particularly like.
This may be resolved with the correct size.
I was worried about the color, but they are a light gray and I like them.
Took these shoes to Fall Creek Falls.
Kept my feet dry.
I hiked 13 miles two days after getting these and they were perfectly comfortable.
I always buy the same size and they always fit.
Today is my first day to wear them.
I will need to wear them more before I can give a full review.I have had them on for 7 hours so far and just a small amount of discomfort but this is my first day to wear them.
I wore them today on a hike and I had no back issues and they are very durable.
Did not keep my feet as warm as anticipated.
They are somewhat narrow, thus the complaints of the seam digging into the tops of people's feet.
I did not have this problem, but they are very snug with regular socks.
It you plan to wear these with thick socks, order a size larger.
The 10.5 B I ordered fit like a 9.5N.  I am exchanging them for an 11B, since they don't come in wide width
When you walk the sides and toes rub a little, and they fit appropriate otherwise.
Too slow in the mail to send back.
Columbia shoes seem to run on the larger side,ordered a pair of their sandals and they also run larger.Have not  really worn these yet just tried them on so I dont know how they will feel wearing them.
I wear size 10 but if I could I would of bought size 9.5...
A littttle slippery when it was solid ice but that's to be expected.
Didn't take much to break them in but I do have high arches but a $5 Kroger pair of insoles did the job.
They are water proof so might be a little warm to wear in the summer.
The only issue I had with the boot was it was loose in the upper part on my leg.
I was worried I would have to break them first on a short hike, it turned out I felt no discomfort on climbing up/down on the first hime.
I am glad I chose them.
A little rough not broken in!
They fit a bit large but that is because I bought them a bit large on purpose since I have wide feet and it is difficult for me to find the right fit.
They don't slip on the snow which is very important for me.
I bought these to go hiking for my first time ever, and I didn't really get a chance to really break them in before I went, and even though I also didn't have hiking socks on, the boots were super comfortable and I had no blisters after hiking a 10 mile trail.
Unfortunately, during my hike, we a bad rain storm hit so about half of the trek back was made in heavy rain and after I got back to my car, my feet were actually dry.
Wearing a Nike sports sock in it and not to loose or tight.
I wore them at least 13 hours and once I learned to tie them properly they were also pretty comfortable.
The only not-so-great part was my feet eventually ended up completely soaked - total bummer.
Haba sido un sueo por muchos aos!En mi pas Colombia no tenemos estas oportunidades tan a menudo.Gracias
I walked miles in them the first time and no rubbing or blisters at all!
Yo quera que me quedara pero no est muy sacado o muy apretado como lo dicen ustedes me decepciono
But, I have two problems with them.
Second, I am quite sure that they are not leather.
But, further down it says that it is leather and mesh.It seems a bit false to have some colors be leather and others not.Also, there is no Columbia logo on them, which did not bother me, really, but it could mean these are a knock-off.Bottom line is that I will probably return them.
I haven't worn these hiking yet, my true test for hiking boots is after at least 4-5 miles.
That's usually when my feet start really hurting so time will tell, but I did wear them out just into town and they seem comfortable.
I know that's not much help.
Leyendo los comentarios de que el zapato era ms pequeo orden media talla ms (talla 9 US, 26 cm)  de la que usualmente uso (8.5 US 25.5 cm), pero el zapato es demasiado grande y ancho, por lo que aconsejo pedir su talla normal o media talla menos, un 8 me hubiese quedado bien.
I normally wear a size 10 and had tried a size 10 of these boats on in a store.
Thought they were a little small and they did not have any larger sizes.
Was expecting problems with grip based on other reviews, but I've had no problems whatsoever!
Been backpacking two times now in these shoes and they are fit perfectly!
I have worn them for a few days and they are ready to go hiking now.
Excellent traction yet not a heavy boot.
and basically every store is closed so I cant go get it removed so I can use them soon... not sure what to do about that but maybe Google will know.
I have been wearing these for months now and can tell they will last!
Not weird looking on the front either.
Las use para subir el pico de Orizaba y no sufr de frio.
Me quedaron un poco grandes (un numero) con respecto al que uso normalmente pero para lo que las quiero si me funcionan.
As with all Columbia products, you can't beat them.
I have a job where I walk around in the woods all day, and they are exactly what I was looking for.
They also keep my feet very dry.
I already have a pair of brown Columbia hiking boots and I wore them all over Europe.
Unlike my tennis shoes, they kept my feet comfortable while walking over cobblestoned areas.
So, it was an easy choice to return to the Columbia brand when I wanted a pair of black boots.
They are so comfortable Im going to wear them for style too.
I saw the same style in stores to wear with jeans.
These have been great so far, they fit as expected and I even have a wider foot but not quite enough to look for specifically wide shoes.
They are a bit stiff, but that is to be expected.
I usually wear 6.5/7 and have wide feet so I bought these in 7's.
No break-in period was needed either.
Used in shallow water too and didnt leak through.
I haven't really used them yet, but they are super light.
They also have really good ankle support, but not too much that it's bothersome.
They were warm, tough and I was able to trudge through the mud with no problem.
By the end of the weekend, I could feel they weren't totally broken in yet, but that's to be expected.
I can't wait to wear them again!
I have short and wide feet.
I did not buy the pair at the retailer because I needed to check Amazon.
There may have been a manufacturing problem because something was poking out inside the shoe.
Iceland has some really rough terrain but these boots got me through all the hikes and kept my feet warm.
It isn't bad for an inexpensive hiking boot.
It does not have good arch support and I think that the arch of the boot isn't in the same place as the arch of my foot.
i.e. they do not bend.
I wore them around the house and could tell after a few hours that they wouldn't be right for me.
I'm an 8.5, ordered an 8.5, and took them to work the next day with no blisters.
Your feet feel as if they are burning and I often have to put water on them to cool them down.
I'm a field biologist working in San Clemente Island and we hike where there's lots of cholla and prickly pears.
Very painful.
The worst part is that this is the only pair of boots I have with me on the island so I have to suffer with them until I get off.
I was hesitant to get boots online without trying them on but they are perfect.
Havent broken them in completely, but they fit snugly with a bit of extra toe room for thick socks and swelling after a long hike.
Also got great traction on slippery rocks while fishing at the levee.
I have a hard time with shoes and this is the 3rd pair of hiking boots I've tried to buy and couldn't get the size right.I wear between a 10.5 and 11 and ordered a 10.5.
We went for a 6 mile hike the weekend after I'd gotten them and they were perfect!
I am normally a 12.
Read up on different tying methods to stop toe crease in the boot.
I ordered them for her especially since she has major back problems and her back didn't hurt at all while we were hiking.
Excellent fit, not heavy and supportive to my aging knees and ankles.
flat walking in the park is about all I can manage at 74.
Shes worn them in the rain and on dry trips as well.
I really like them but they could be a little less stiff in the sole.
I've have them the weeks and they ste still stiff
But this has never happened to any of my other boots and I have a boot collection.
I am forced to return the boots.
I bought these boots for my wife, who was looking for a replacement for her aging Dexter boots.
Being leather, they were slightly stiff out of the box, but after a few days of wear, were very comfortable.
They didnt require any breaking in time and i went on many long hikes with them in chile and south africa with no problems.
Top part of boot is stiff but I'm expecting that to lesson after time
Cannot wait to hike in these boots after I break them in!
I have only worn these at home so far.
There is plenty of room in the toe box so they arent too snug.
I wore them every day for 2 weeks and my feet never hurt, never got wet in the rain.
Recently wore on a trip to NY wore around Times Square etc because it was cold.
I have worn my Columbia Hiking boots for several years, I hiked so much I wore out the bottoms of my first pair and bought myself another pair.
This is the review I have written year after year...  BUT this time, my boots don't fit the same.
My old ones are more comfortable, just the soles are worn down, these are tighter and are NOT as comfortable.
sadly the toe box is too narrow.
I normally buy up a half size when buying boots, and these would have been too big.
I normally wear a 8 or 9 so I got a 8.5.
They're a little big but I figure I'll just wear thick socks in the winter with them.
Honestly cannot recommend these enough -- purchased them before a trip to Glacier National Park but also wear them a lot for hiking back in Arizona.
not too tight in toes and doesn't give me blisters.
I can actually buy them on line and they fit great.I still have my 2nd pair of boots for home and have a new pair to keep in our R.V. I told my friend about these boots last year, we went shopping for her and she end up really like them too.
However, they have very little arch support and I was not able to get them to fit quite right around the ankles.
always use this boots with long socks, my mistake was really painful the first time I used without it.
Even though I didn't walk a lot!
I am going to buy different laces, as they tend to come undone.
I have been able to use them when I go hiking or casually going out.
El zapato es para uso senderismo, es cmodo pero no me dur nada a lactar de puesta se despeg el plstico de la punta
I like these boots, they have held up well the last 6 months.
I have to tight them a little differently so the metal doesn't dig into the top of my foot.
I would give four stars instead of five and the reason is that the shoes are so easily get dirty when there is dust on the road.
I cannot tell the original color of the shoes after walked on a dirt road.
Fast delivery and never even had to break them in, comfortable from day one.
Good width, lightweight, somewhat waterproof, but does bend at an awkward spot at the toe which can cause some irritation when youre up to you 6th mile in.
Its not like its unbearable, just annoying.
Was just hoping for something in this price range to be a little more thought through.
It also runs a little small.
Ive gone on a few hikes with these so far (one over 8 miles) and have zero complaints.
Even on the rainiest day her feet remain dry yet they're still lightweight and comfortable!
rocky, grassy, muddy and wet, even used them for some rock scrambling and they have held up well!
I broke the boots in on this trip and came out with blisters albeit none of them were impairing my performance.
Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.
Been wearing them for a few months now, almost daily, and so far they've held up just fine.
I  dislike that the boot is not "WATERPROOF,"  and could be a little more comfortable in the foot bed.
I received these boots in the mail on 1/31 and I wore them today (2/4) due to the snow melting.
I thought these would do the job but I was very disappointed because I work outside all day and had wet feet for almost 11 hours.
I gave 2 stars because they are not waterproof as described and the foot bed does not have the best comfort.
I couldn't forget about how well they fit though, and how light they were.
Wore them in Iceland for 5 days and did not take any other shoes.
I usually wear 8.5 or occasionally 9.
They are a little loose for me even though I purchased my usual size.
Especially when tied a bit tighter on a particularly long hike.
I got size 11 W not too tight and very comfy!
They were extremely comfy without having to break them in and were completey waterproof.
The only thing is that they will rub your ankles raw if you dont wear thick socks.
Perfect fit for my 8.5 flat feet.
Very comfortable for prolonged wear and everyday use.
Only regret is that it runs slightly big.
So I am giving it 5 stars anyway as its my fault for not taking the suggested advice!
We are planning a big camping trip and I wanted to make sure the boots were well broken in before that.
The first time I tried them on they were comfortable--no need to break them in.
I walked a couple of miles in them and had no new-shoe pain.
I have the Mens Newton Ridge Plus II boots and they are just as nice as these.
I would advise to order your exact size, as these shoes are sized just right.
No need to up-size or down-size.
Everything was as expected!!
Might run half a size smaller than your usual.
I wore these hiking boots through thick, slimy mud and they came through for me.
I didn't feel any wetness - definitely worth the money to buy them.
Went hiking in Colorado and they have not disappointed me yet!
They aren't snug or too loose.
I bought a half size up for thick socks but even with thin socks they aren't loose they fit well.
It took a few days to break them in, but that's to be expected.
These boots are light to not like the other hiking boots I've owned in the past, so there is not that extra weight to lug about.
I didn't submerge in water, but walks to shallow creeks with them on and my feet stayed completely dry.
I didn't really break them in before taking them to Colorado for hiking and never got blisters or sore feet.
So glad I bought these boots for wet, slippery walking in the Highlands of Scotland.
I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for something I do 2 weeks a year.
Didn't even have to break them in!
I wore once before, to make sure I didn't need to break them in.
Easy clean too,  i like it so much!
These boots are so comfortable soft leather and low at the heel like the true hiking boots are.
I wear them all the time and didnt have to break them in even.
I've worn them in tall, very wet grass and thru puddles and my socks and feet stay nice and dry.
Haven't had a chance to wear them for an extended period but definitely comfortable.
I wear a women's US s10.5/11 narrow normally, but the 10 B (M) fits well.
I work in a warehouse on concrete floors and they give me the support I need for my ankles and feet.
I wear a size 8.5 normally and I ordered an 8.5 and it fit perfectly.
I have narrow feet, and these fit well without being too cramped
they also have a high toe box for comfortable long-distance and up-and-down hiking.My sister, who wears Size 11 recently ordered the same boot on my recommendation.
I chose .5 size up as recommended by other reviews and they are slightly larger for me, no need for exhange.They look amazing and warm in cold weather (-15 degree).
I sprained my ankle really badly at the end of summer so I needed something with ankle support but also something that wasnt clunky or heavy.
I am a 5.5/6.
Bought them for a week of hiking in Zion (paved & unpaved trails), Bryce (lots of snow), and the Grand Canyon and couldn't be more pleased.
The boots didn't even require a "break-in" period before putting them to use.
Comet un error al comprar este artculo no me fij que era de mujer y yo lo quiero de hombre y lo ped como 9.5 como puedo hacer para devolverlo y poder comprar el de hombre en la misma size 9.5
There was a problem with my order I was almost charged twice.
But the shoe was narrow and hurt my foot as soon as I tried it on.
I'm so disappointed.
The only bad thing is that the surface is a little bit too hard and uncomfortable, but given that it is a hiking boot I think it's fine.
Hope that it will get more comfortable after I wear it for several days.
They fit as expected.
Not too much to say.
You will not be disappointed.
I had broken them in before hiking but still got blisters on both heels.
De media kon niet worden geladen.
The thickened shoelace attachment panel digs down into the toe box causing blisters and painful pressure points.
The only problem is they pushed on the top of my foot a bit when walking which I expect to maybe ease up a bit once I break them in.
After that they began to fall apart, they last three months before the bottom came off.
To be fair I am a zookeeper and I wore them every day at work.
I dont regret it one bit.
They were given as a gift and did not disappoint.
The first wear my foot felt like it was getting smashed by the toe crease which ended up giving me a blister on both big toes.
I unfortunately am going to just give these to someone as I can't wear them or return them.
I wear a women's size 12 so for years I have settled for buying men's hiking shoes which are typically wider then I need.
I was able to wear these shoes and hike around the Christmas markets for hours upon end without getting blister or feeling like I had broken in a new pair of boots.
Long walks, hikes are no problem in these boots.
So far, they are holding up.
36 miles in 3 days and not one blister.
I didn't have to break them in at all.
I can wear them all day my ankles are supported.
I ordered my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly!!
I do recommend getting thicker, above the ankle, hiking socks so the ankle area doesn't rub on your skin.
My only problem is that the tongue doesn't ever want to stay in place.
It comes loose and rubs on my girlfriend's feet when she wears them causing blisters and worn spots.
No matter what socks she wears, it happens.
No matter how tight or loose she laces them, it happens.
I thought they would just break in like some boots do, but no.
They cause her pain every time she wears them.
They are hiking boots meant to be walked long distances in and she cannot get more than a mile without ending up with blisters.
El producto me vino con unos rayones en su parte frontal como si alguien los hubiese usado y pegado con algo
A little wide, but maybe with thicker socks this winter that will be a good thing.
No slipping even with my dog pulling his lead downhill!Would recommend.
Anytime you squat and need to toe to bend it pinches and is painful.
These are not worth the money, I tried wearing them multiple times just to make sure I didnt like them and each time they were as painful as the last.
Dont waste your money.
They were the cutest waterproof boots I could find so I was disappointed they were painful to wear but I ended up finding a less attractive pair for half the price and hecka comfy for a 14 hour shift outside.
These boots are exactly what I expected!
And I can comfortably wear thick socks with them and I didn't have to size up from my regular size.
I wear them for commuting in bad weather and the grip is nice
I love the boot but I have a very thin foot and it's a little roomy.
Also so cute that they could be worn for any leisure activity besides hiking!
They were too big.
Fit as expected and don't need to wear them in.
Scratch that, maybe you would if you were hiking long distances.
no wear, no tear, no blisters.
They're waterproof and comfotable, they keep the heat in so my toes didn't freeze.
I was able to climb and step over rocks without the discomfort of feeling them through the soles of my tennis shoes.
I've had these boots for 2 years and hiked through New Zealand mountains in rain, dirt, and mud as well as New England local hikes.
Anti theft tag was left on the boots and I don't know how to remove it.
The hooks that hold the laces near the tops are far too deep, and even when you have laces in them they are deep enough to also catch the laces on your other boot.
Within a few minutes of wearing these boots I nearly tripped and fell on my face, because the hook on the inside of my left boot had caught the laces on my right boot and "tied" my feet together.
Maybe it's unlikely that it would happen again, but I cannot run the risk of hurting myself while hiking because of a design flaw like this.I ordered the Columbia Crestwood hiking boots and they do not have this problem, if you are still interested in a Columbia boot.
pruchase "waterproof" boots from a few little incidents that caused wet feet and misery!
I have worn them around our farm to try out the fit, feel and to test just the level of waterproof protection, and so far they are awesome!
I am pleasantly surprised to discover how well made, warm, and dry they are when water imis involved.
Parfait, comme sur la description
Based on a few reviews, I ordered a half size up, but ended up returning.
The return process was super easy with Amazon Prime.
I received my refund faster than expected.
The new shoes came in and I couldn't be happier.
Be sure to break them in first before a long hike.
I wasn't sure how they'd be since I wouldn't have time to wear them in before my trip to iceland.
I wore these while glacier hiking and spent a considerable amount of time outdoors walking around, etc for a week.
I get plantar fascitis easily and my feet will throb at night when I'm laying down but I didn't have any pain and no blisters at all!
Bought these for work, kept my feet dry all day!
I wanted to like these boots because I bought some even more horrific boots (more expensive) I have to return too... but I couldn't.
Not sure how reviews are so good, but the fit is completely off.
The top of the shoe folds down into the foot, creasing.
Maybe they are too cheaply made (in China), bc it just feels exactly that.
CHEAP (And miraculously, the price is not...) I would give these a pass.
I like a specific timberland boot that doesn't seem to come in black.
Guess I know not to bother with Columbia boots... I'm willing to spend a little more for quality, but these are junk.
I grabbed these straight out of the box, put them on and spent the whole day walking around campus.
No need to break them in.
I have always worn a size 6.5 or 7 shoe.
Ordered a 6.5 in these boots and they were almost a size too large
too big even with heavy socks.
I bought them almost a year ago and I wear them every chance I get.
They're a bit bulky in shape and size, but not overly heavy.
I use it for work where it is cold and wet place.
I bought a new pair and fell in love all over again.I lead Creek walks in an outdoor education program and my feet remain dry.
I use them as a farm work boot not for hiking.
They are comfortable (not too heavy) and they have held up very well.
Also they keep my feet dry.
I have no regrets.
I've worn them in different environments, and they can keep you warm, but not too hot, even when I was in Hawaii.
I proudly trudge through puddles, and shallow bodies of water.
The boots came in on time and fit perfectly, just the right amount of support without being too tight.
I didnt experience the uncomfortable bending at the toes like other customers.
I wore these right out of the box and had a little rubbing on the back of my ankle, but I had low cut socks on.
After the first day they did not bother me at all.
But not suited for hiking.
need betterarch support, i had to buy one separate but besides that all good
I wore them with fairly worn socks.
I wasnt cursing st the end of a 13 mile hike.
I wear a size 11.
Only complaint is that the toe box is a little small and puts pressure on my little toes.
Would have been nice if they could have offered a wide size.
We don't all have tiny Cinderella feet.
De las mejores compras que he hecho por Amazon.
This boot runs a little on the narrow side.
I was a bit reluctant ordering these boots online.
Couldn't be happier.
I wore these on a 5 .5 mile hike, no breaking in period necessary.
Normally I wear an 8, but in this shoe I was equally between 8 and 8.5, but with wool socks the 8.5 fit perfectly.
I went through mud and incline and they held up very well.
The only issue is while hiking at any kind of angle, the leather creases and creates some discomfort, but on level ground, thats not noticeable.
Thats the only thing that keeps me from also getting them in brown.
I had to return them, however, because with both thin or thick socks, when I walked, the crease on the top of the boot cut right into the top of my toe box.
I have never, ever, had that issue with any other shoes/boots before.
My feet are not wide, so I never ever have an issue with the toe box area in shoes.
Other reviewers have also mentioned this recently, so I'm not sure if perhaps this is a bad batch.
I would have preferred eyelet holes rather than the riveted lace holders used.
LOVE these hiking boots, went on a 5 mile hike and I didn't need to break them in, my feet were fine at the end of the day.
fit was a tiny big but the next size down would be too small.
They're a little firmer in the ankle area than is maybe ideal for me (I like some flexibility) but they're meant for ankle protection and I'm sure they do that well.
We haven't had fresh snow since I bought them
I have wide feet and these are too narrow for me so I had to return them.
However, they were kind of tight and the toe box could be a bit roomier.
I have always worn a woman's size 7 and these were snugger that what I expected.
I wore them for the first time straight out of the box for a 6 hour hike in the mountains along the Italian Riviera and my feet did not hurt once.
Ive hiked in them regularly since purchasing them 2 years ago and they havent failed me yet.
They survived hiking the Angel's Landing trail in Zion and never lost traction even on extremely steep inclines and icy slopes.
Went hiking with them.
I didn't think they would be the most reliable since it unexpectedly snowed.
I like the two tones colors, very confortable to walk, even for long distances.
I was a little nervous ordering larger, but they were the perfect size.
No pinching or ankle rubbing.
I just walk through mud now.
Fairly grippy on the bottom so I don't slide in the wet grass
Walked around inside for a while then went outside  and did about 3 hours of farm chores .
I found these boots stiff and uncomfortable, compared to my other hiking boots, so I sent them back (however, my husband loved the men's version)
Havent worn them out yet, but they seemed a little bigger than my usual size 7s.
have not had the opportunity to wear yettried them and like them
0 arch support .
They don't need to be broken in and they're super comfortable.
They fit as expected.
Also, they're not super ugly like most other hiking boots!
I wear these 6 days a week in the barn.
Sadly, though the price was right- but the boots weren't.
I took them on a few hikes hoping to break them in, but they remained stiff as the first day I wore them.
I have narrow feet, and perhaps that has something to do with it, but I think the shoes are just stiff.
Perhaps some people like this, but I didn't.
Wish there was more arch support.
However, they are NOT waterproof.
I've worn them through airports and through snowy glacial hikes, and they were great for both.
I wish i had time to order size up.
There was no room to fit my orthotics or just a pair of thicker socks.
I guess it would have been an ok boot if used with thin socks and without any inserts.
I am continuing to look for a waterproof hiking boot that can be worn with thicker socks.
I looove my boots but I had to return them and re-purchase them because they run big.
The bad part about that was that after I purchased them the first time the price shot up and I re-purchased them at a higher price.
Amazon said there was nothing that could do about that.
Pretty lame
I am alwas outside running around and these are perfict.
They do take a wail to break in however which I didn't mind becuse that usually means they last longer.
I wear a 10 tennis shoe but this boot is too big about half a size.
I also find that it's not very  comfy as I had hoped.
Went for a 3 mile hike to break them in and just a little tight in the toe but overall no blisters and great support!
Sleek look too.
I went into like 2 inches of water and mud and dirt and nothing came in my shoe!
Haven't worn these out hiking yet, but they do run a bit large - I ordered 8.5's and they will have plenty of room for a nice thick hiking sock.
Have worn them around the house for a while and they seem nice - especially for the price!
I looked to see if maybe they sent me a wide width but did not.
I lace them up because they are too wide and now I have pulled off one of the grommets by trying to get them tight.
Probably will not purchase again.
Didn't fully test out the water resistant properties but from the little bit of treading through mud and water, my feet stayed dry.
As others have said, the toe box was a little big and you can feel the roominess but it didn't bother me at all.
I was going to order a half size up since they are boots and I wanted to leave plenty of room to wear thick socks, but after reading everybody else's reviews I stuck with my typical tennis shoe size and the fit is perfect!
Very comfortable and supportive, not too heavy.
I have a double A foot and feared these would be too loose.
The leather is very soft, padded area around my ankle is a blessing!
They don't look klunky at all which was my fear.
I had no blistersnor any sore spots.
Also, they are waterproof and I was impressedhow good the tread gripped on slippery surfaces.
I am on the way to an outback trip in the Rockies and needed a rugged shoe.
My foot, however, is long and narrow.
Before ordering I read the reviews and hesitated before ordering because some people had problems with them hurting by rubbing their ankles and other problems.
Wore them from 9am till 3pm and had no problems with discomfort.
They are a little longer than expected but I'm not worried about wearing thicker socks for when it's colder.
They cute but made my feet sweat they never sweat and felt so heavy like I have to carry my feet haha over all the look is nice, but not comfy what so ever
I bought this boot looking for something durable but not so bulky.
For the price you cannot find a leather waterproof boot.
They've lasted for miles of hikes, but I wouldn't say they were the most comfortable.
They kept my feet dry as I hiked up right alongside Vernal Falls and then down John Muir.
They were sturdy and did not let me down.
I wear a size 11 usually but sometimes that can run too small so I ordered a 12 in these boots.
I kept them because there are limited boots available in a women's 11 or 12 but I'm not sure they'll be my "favorites" as a lot of other posts have indicated.
I wore them on a rather limited hour plus hike this past weekend.
I ordered to them go to Iceland and I didn't feel a thing and very comfortable.
I work 12-13 hours a day and when I go home my feet feel great !
They are slightly snug but not enough that I would recommend going a size up.
However, I had the same problem in the toe box as many other reviewers mentionedhowever, only in the left boot.
This persisted throughout the reminder of our hikes and I wound up with a blister that turned in to a sore.
My only regret is not buying them sooner.
I needed hiking boots since the cheap ones I bought melted (yes - you read that right).
I walked rocky trail for at least 9 miles and I dont have any blister.
They don't hurt after long use but they are heavy.
I have to put orthodics in the boots for arch support.
I normal wear 8.5 however, I ordered size 9 because I'm always wearing two pair of socks  so I did not want the boots to be to tide.
I wore them for the first time for over six hours in wet rough terrain.
Sturdy and protect my feet and keep them dry.
you would think being sturdy, it would be uncomfortable at first .
I dont hike in them, I wear them to my kids hockey games.
I was worried they were going to be hot or too stiff bouncing around some rocks but they were just perfect.
No blisters, no gross overheated feet.
Haven't worn them yet but felt comfortable and correct size.
Because she's clumsy and trips over thin air, I wanted something that provided ankle support.
they do have a wider foot bed so your toes aren't jammed against the front.
I only wish they were insulated so my feet would stay warmer!
Shoes are not breathable like described.
I have flat feet and Im standing all day for work.
The reviews I read led me to believe I needed to order a size larger which I did but they are a little too big even with thick hiking socks.
I have hiked all kinds of mountains with very rocky terrain and have had no blisters or sore feet.
I walked in these for hours and my fit did not hurt in any capacity, which is rare for me.
I have to wear really thin socks with them or my toes go numb.
Other than that, I really like them.
Columbia quality does not disappoint!
I'm gonna double down as a pair of city snow boots in the winter.
I'm not sure if this is made worse by the fact that I have skinny ankles (I'm 5' 5", 115lbs), but I cannot get the tongues on these to stay closed!
I eventually realized that the top eyelet for the laces is extremely low down on the shoe compared to other hiking boots!
(If you compare to the mens shoe, you will see what I mean!)
It's a shame because they have great tread, no break in period and are extremely comfortable.
The top of the toes are pretty marked up from kneeling, but that is just superficial, does not effect the performance at all.
I've hiked over 10 miles in them and love them.
I said I could wear them all day because I have been breaking them in before my hike.
I have not worn them on a hike yet so really can't say how comfortable they will feel.
So far I really like them.
I never needed to break them in and they never gave me blisters.
I've walked 12 miles on early morning and dewy grass, and my feet have stayed dry.
We gave up on trying to walk around the track and ended up standing in the bar for several hours.
It's not water proof, but it is water resistant.
I wear a 7.5 in Nike and Adidas running shoes, I purchased 7.5 for these shoes.
I can wear compression socks with normal gym socks under them and the boots will still fit.
My size was not available, so I ordered the womens.
I really like the Newton Ridge boot since I need to wear them all day at work and they are comfortable.
A shoelace hook on the left foot broke off after the 5th wear!
Have hiked several long hikes and they are comfortable.
When I got this pair I wasn't disappointed.
They are a little stiff to begin with, but formed to my feet perfectly, and are very comfortable.
I didn't even need to break these in when I took them for a 7 mile hike outside of Portland, Oregon.
I can't wait for the weather to get warmer so I can test these out in New York!
Good sizing not too tight.
Unfortunately it was too narrow for me and I would be unable to wear winter socks.
I had to return them.
I don't hike often, but wanted these for the times I do!
There were several reviews about the toe area pressing down when you walked.
She wore them immediately for a 6 mile hike and had no complaints about her  feet.
A little loose with my hiking socks but honestly they were still super comfy!
Only taken them on short hikes so far but they are awesome!
Cant go wrong with these shoes ever.
Bought these boots as a replacement to an identical pair of Colombia boots that I  have worn daily for work (in a very large outside garden department) for a year and a half.
These boots offer excellent foot cushioning and ankle support and after working all day wearing them I don't feel like my feet are going to fall off, I will purchase these again as needed.
I even wore the for a 3 hour glacier hike, which we had to add crampons onto our shoes - still super comfortable and my feet were completely dry.
It did not take long to break in and once broken in was very comfortable.
However, it doesn't hold up in my line of work, greenhouse nursery, where it's exposed to lots of moisture on a daily basis.
The glue on the sides at the bottom is coming loose and I don't expect I'll get much more than 6 months use out of these boots.
First pair of serious hiking boots.
There's nothing special about these for me.
The fit is a little big and the ankle support just rubbed blisters onto me.
I don't like how wide the bottoms are
2 stars because they do seem very durable, but I won't find out because I'll definitely be getting rid of them.
But the walking part (the biggest thing) hurts because of the toe bends!
Ugh I read the reviews but I thought maybe I wouldnt experience it but I did right off the bat.
I do use a different insole as I have fallen arches but no problem there either.
Ordered my normal size (7womens) and shoe was too large.
Might have been able to wear thicker socks to wear them but I also had the problem mentioned in other comments.
when kneeling down the crease on the top part of the shoe was like hard plastic digging into the top of my foot.
It hurt to the point where I wouldn't even be able to break them in.
No way I could have worn these for even one day even if they did fit.
It was that bad.
Fits well around foot and waterproof BUT the closure around the ankle does not hold secure.
Almost like the tongue is to narrow and the laces can not be tightened enough to.feel like the boot it snug.
I have always worn a 9.5 shoe.
I purchased this in 9.5 and when I tried them on it felt too large in the toe area and had a very uncomfortable bend right across my toes when I walked.
If I would have walked a long period of time in these it would have rubbed so uncomfortably across my toes that no doubt it would have left a mark or blister.
I used these boots for hikes in my last trip, and I just a problem in 1 day: the leather was folding in a position that was hurting an area close to the nail of my big toe.
Only dislike is the padded tongue wants to bow out instead of laying flat when laced.
I purchased these books for my significant other who has weak ankles in order to wear during hiking trips to the Grand Canyon and Arches Nation Park.
Each time she wears them, they are so poorly designed they cause her blisters that have bled.
We went for a short practice hike of 2 miles and by the end she could barely walk.
The seam on the top of the ball of the foot does not properly flex with your foot when you walk, causing it to roughly rub the top of your foot raw with blisters.
I regret buying these boots and wish I had discovered their design flaws before the window of return was available.
Please do not make the mistake we made and find some boots that are designed to fit a human foot.
they are very comfortable and I didn't need to break them in.
They are a little narrow for my wide feet and I have high arches so I put in some insoles for additional arch support.
I didn't even have to break them in.
Its lightweight and very comfortable from the first day of wear!
She wears them sweeping snow off the sidewalks and shopping and running erands too.
And she says she gets lots of compliments from other women too.
I think she is going to wear them out.
I have flat feet and have a difficult time finding shoes to fit properly.
I wear them all day.
They got me through 19 miles in Grand Canyon with zero blisters.
The shoe was a little stiff getting into it but as room as I wore them for a few hours they formed right to my fit.
I've already traveled through rainforests in Costa Rica in them both high lands and low lands and never had an issue with them.
They seem super nice, but I unfortunately had to return.
When it rained I did feel like my feet felt wet but didn't stay in the rain long.
Incredibly comfortable, water proof, and quick to dry.
I bought these before doing a section of the AT and I didn't even need to break them in.
I was NOT disappointed.
Took a bit of time to break them in completly, but a few hikes in and they're already feeling quite comfortable.
I wear boots for my line of work for the past 22 years, always difficult for me to find comfortable boots, I decided to give these a try, wow, light, comfy and durable.
They are boots, not sandals.
Not slippery on a steep climb.
These boots do not have enough padding around the ankles.
The lack of padding and the seam at the ankle on the inside of the boot makes my ankle sore after only 5 minutes of wearing, so I think it would feel very uncomfortable during a hike.
There are plenty of boots out there with more padding around the ankle if you are willing to spend a bit more.
Other than the ankle issue, the boots are reasonably comfortable.
I did try it after all, in smaller in a shop, but it's not a comfortable walking shoes and provoke pain on your big toes right away.
I tried to buy cheap hiking boots on a 25 mile hike and I paid for it with blisters.
Had they not done this, then I would have kept them.
I liked everything about them but could not stand to get my big toe beat up every step I took
So far I have hiked about 15 miles in 2 hikes and my feet stay dry, warm and haven't hurt.
Fit exactly as expected!
They're my first pair of hiking boots and once (if ever) I wear them out I'll probably repurchase these.
I have had a hard time finding hiking boots I like...I mainly wear for casual wear in the winter.
Helped me keep my balance and provided stability around my ankles.
They fit as expected.
Ive wore them a few times not and they are still intact and waterproof.
I cant wait to wear them when I go hiking in Colorado!
They are Very light with no inside padding.
Just not what I expected.
I've worn these hiking several times so far and they are very comfortable.
They never make my feet sore and they seem like they will last a very long time.
The first pair is still usable, but I really didn't take proper care of them and used them working in a blueberry field.
But where the toe bends it is a bit painful and took some time to break in.
I had been wanting hiking boots, need them for a costume party and wore them for several hours walking around.
El artculo es muy bueno, y de muy buena calidad.
There is a small issue with the toe box area, it bends and hits tops of the toes, but only on the left.
We are in northern Indiana and it has been in the teens!!
Walked around all day and they were very comfy, no rubbing anywhere ,happy to say no blisters
I have worn them for 2 days, all day and find them very comfortable.
Live in a rural area on 10 acres and walk those acres everyday with my labs.
Would not hesitate to recommend them.
Wore them all day and legs/feet never got tired.
Also kept feet dry in light rain.
Across the toe area when the toes bend when taking a step, the creased area is hard and pinches the toes across the top of the toes.
Very hard and uncomfortable.
However, when walking, the bend of the toe box hits the top of my foot and causes some discomfort.
I don't think it will be a problem for the amount of walking  I'll be doing in them.
But I definitely won't be doing any serious hiking in them.
Purchased to wear in Iceland for hiking.
they weren't tight or small but painful when walking.
Thinking I just needed to break them in, I tried them out a few times but ended up returning them because I couldn't imagine walking in them anymore.
I like the product very much, but I have ordered wrong size.
Me quedaron muy bien son comodisimas y las he usado para estsr de pie por mas de 12 hrs.
Seems sturdy, but it doesn't have the arch support I was hoping for.
One is long enough to tie and normal, but the other one was only long enough to tie in a knot.
Even though I'm wearing the proper size, the heel of the boot has worn down completely and is now rubbing and causing blisters.
It digs into my toes a little but doesn't hurt too bad.
It is slightly small for the size but not overall uncomfortable.
We did several hikes on yellowstone and rockies no major issue.
Have worn these while working with and riding my horse in all kids of weather and muck.
Don't have to pay the big bucks for those Ariat boots which self destruct at the seams in no time.
Very comfortable for long walks.
Ive been wearing them for over a month and I feel like I been wear them for years there so nice and comfortable I wish I would of bought them years ago they help my walk
If they ever get worn enough that I need another pair (which I doubt they will), I would buy the same exact pair all over again.
I've worn them hiking all over the place and they're extremely comfortable.
Love the fact that I did not have to break in the boots.
Ive ever encountered this before I decided since I had paid so much for them and they seemed to run big and were too big for me I decided to return them.
Im sure they are perfectly wonderful boots but I was a little disappointed considering how they arrived.
Columbia footwear never disappoints.
Not on the ends, the shoe was plenty big enough, but on the top sides of the nail.
Not sure if "breaking in" will help or not, but I will probably end up getting something different.
I'm a true size 9 and they seem to be a little big.
Even just trying them on in my house I could tell where the shoe creases over my toes would be a huge problem if I ever went for a real hike.
It was painful from the get go.
Considered sizing down to 8.5 but after reading further reviews I'll just try a different boot.
I have not yet worn them on a hike.
However, I have worn them around the house and they did not rub me anywhere.
Used in Iceland and never had cold or wet feet
I chose this boot because I wanted something neutral.
The inner sole is cushier than I expected, which is nice.
I've been able to wear them all day and have no problems with aching feet.
I love this boot, but after two months am disappointed.
I work in a big box store and have been wearing Columbia boots for years.
I have never had this issue with any previously owned Columbia boots.
Just a little cold in ice cave.
They are kind of painful to break in.
I wear a size 11.
Me encant el producto, son cmodos y sper frescos, no me los quitos, lo recomiendo ampliamente
They keep my feet dry and arent too bulky compared to other shoes.
Did a 6 mile hike without even breaking them in and no blisters!
I was hopeful that with wear that I will be able to break them in, but after using them daily for 4 days straight for a fairly flat 1.5 mile walk, I am doubtful.
I have made adjustments by waring heavier socks and shifting my foot in the front of the boot as much as possible, and that has helped, but they still aren't what I would call comfortable.
It's a shame because they look great and seem very durable.
It's just a poor design!
I did not wanted to see if they get more comfortable and just returned them .
Sadly this hiking boot was more like a pair of tennis shoes - both in style, fit and sole.
It was light weight but not at all nice, tight in toe box and nothing like I expected of a hiking boot (I needed something for my winter trip to new zealand).
The only reason they get 4 stars is because of the tongues of the shoes
one really has to work to get them to lay flat.
They are still very stiff after a week, I've been slowly trying to break them in.
I wear a narrow shoe and these do not slip on my heel!
My feet are slightly wide but wide fit are too wide and some average size are too narrow.
Imagine my surprise when I go to try them on theres no cushion only hard board.
There was no breaking in period.
I don't get it.
I can't wear them for 5 minutes.
I just ordered another pair to see if it is a manufacturing problem with the pair I received.
I fit a 7M which is a 1/2 size than my normal shoe size.
After walking a few steps, I started feeling that my toes where pushed down by the front top part of the boot.
I recommend you try boots in a store before ordering them, make sure you can walk comfortably!
I went on a hiking trip and I can't imagine having to walk all those miles with these Columbia boots.
It was more money than I wanted to spend but a lot less than comparable boots.
Wont truly know til I wear them this winter.
I have an ankle that didn't heal correctly and I needed something sturdy since I work on my feet.
I have worn these on the beach, on the sidewalk, and on rocky ground and I haven't had an issue with slipping.
Normally I  wear a Size 8 ...was too big.Size 7 was perfect.
But low stars because it is very hard to get on and off.
I don't even feel like they need to be broken in.
Comfortable and easily broken in.
They are super comfortable, fit GREAT and there was almost NO break-in period at all!!!!!
The sizes are also dead on
The only thing wrong with these boots is that they are hot to wear when you are in 77 degree weather.
Wore them all day with no pinching or sore foot - fabulous
Feet did not hurt after 3 hour hike carrying a baby!
Quick delivery too.
I didn't really need a waterproof boot and I bought Merrell Women's Moab Ventilator Mid Hiking boot as a second option.
I wasn't crazy about how these looked although they did feel comfortable.
They fit as expected but I ended up returning them...
The size was true, but I could not even walk aro my living room without pain in my toe.
The toe crease is so deep and severe no way I could even hike to the mail box in these without getting a blister.
I also bought a more expensive Columbia hiking boot to avoid this problem and they both had the same issue!
I wear these full time during the cold months, not just for hiking.
Too bad I cant return them now.
I walk around 10 miles a day for work, and these just didn't hold up.
I ordered a half size larger than my foot as I wear thinner socks.
I get excellant ankle support and across the top of my feet too.
Hope they last a long time....
Really disappointed since they're really cute.
I tried them on when I got home and could not walk in them.
The toe part of the boot bends in when walking and it felt like it was going to cut off my toe!
My only problem with these boots is the cut.
The toe area is too narrow.
I tried 7.5 (my usual size) and 8 but there just wasn't enough room in the toe area.
Sadly, I returned them.
I liked experiencing considerably less pain in hip and knees than w/other types of footwear.
They are not holding up.
Fit is not what it should be a little loose.
Even though I have tightly laced.
Tongue  doesn't stay secure.
Makes for very uncomfortable fit.
Would not buy again.
I bought these because I couldn't find a black Sketcher I liked.
Fit exactly as I thought it would.
Used them for long hikes, after a few hours they start hurting the fit, they are a little hard.
Estoy encantada con mis botas,  ya tengo varios meses usndola y me encantan ?
A little heavy, but they do what they're supposed to do.
Not too heavy and water proof.
Las amo, son bonitas y cmodas, la talla es holgada, perfecta para uso con calceta gruesa!!!
How they behave in the mountains do not know yet, I hope they will not let you down)
Me encantaron, super cmodas y ligeras aunque no lo e probado en la nieve pero creo que si funcionan
I like them, but I feel that I have to brake them.
I have a 'C' width foot so unfortunately this boot was a little snug.
I thought going a size up would help but it didn't.
If it came in a wider width and in leather it would have been a better fit for me.
I ended up with the Merrell Moab 2 instead, which had TREMENDOUSLY better arch support and can be found for about $20-30 more.
Didn't require any breaking in.
I had to return these as they were not wide enough for my feet.
I was not able to actually wear them so I cannot comment on the quality, though they look nice.
I found these painful to wear.
I tried to break them in walking around my living room and they were so painful on my big toes that I couldn't stand it any longer.
I returned them the same day.I bought these hoping the leather would them a softer feel BUT...These boots are very stiff (too stiff for me) and DO require breaking in despite what other reviews say.
The upper feels like plastic, not leather--maybe the leather is too highly treated.In terms of size, they did fit about right.
I have wide feet and I found the B width to be wide enough.
Too bad they dug into my toes.
I like them a lot, they lightweight, comfortable and provide ankle support.
Not too heavy to wear all day.
Purchased for December trip to Colorado but didn't get the opportunity to test the waterproof ability
First off, they aren't completely nerdy looking which is a plus.
Second, I didn't need to work them in at all prior to getting into some serious hikes.
But they don't have much arch support and feel cheap when I wear them.
The shoe laces do come untied/loose easily after walking for a while.
Slightly large but nothing a good pair of socks can't fix.
I'm a petite person with relatively small narrow feet.
Wanted something waterproof that was not too bulky or manly looking.
they were also $20 cheaper then bass pro, who did not have my size.
Their loss :0
Comfortable attractive not too heavy.
Will be wearing them out this weekend to do some hiking.
Have yet to wear them for hiking and winter snowshoeing but I like the look and As I wear them around the house they feel comfortable.Sure hoping for the best
Completed a 5 mile hike a few days ago as my first wear and very happy.
I have not been out in rain yet to test for waterproof.
I cannot believe how lightweight they are yet have great ankle support and awesome tread.
Theyre super comfy and might I add look totally bomb(:
Excellent quality but uncomfortable around the ankle.
In fact, I bought a second identical pair so I wouldn't have to go through all the hassles of trying to find another pair to fit so well in years to come.
I exchanged them for an 8 1/2 M which were way too big.
I was considering keeping them and doubling up on socks but the toe creases and is very painful on my foot.
I cannot imagine hiking all day in these.
If I wanted, I could wear these boots for every day use, but I won't.
Seriously are heavy duty and waterproof!
I had borrowed a friend's pair of Columbia hiking boots so I already knew which size to order (ordered a 1/2 size up from my normal US size).
Ever since I Got these you can't get me out of them.
Shipping was fast too.
I could wear these all day!
They fit as expected, I usually wear an 11 and I did not need to go a size up at all.
Lasted me a year of everyday wear.
Comfortable, light not heavy I love it, I use it for work .
But when wearing thick socks it doesn't hurt anymore.Not stylish so I don't wear it often.
I wear these occasionally when I'm not hiking.
Don't waste your money or time trying to break them in.
The toe breaks over the toes, a little uncomfortable on the left foot.
She normally wears a size 8 and I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly
I bought these because of the Columbia brand but these shoes are very uncomfortable!
wishing I could return them!
Boots were too wide for narrow foot.
Never needed to break them in.
However, I have flat feet and would have appreciated more arch support.
Provides enough room to wear thick hiking sox.
They fit as expected, comfortable and slip resistant
I've been traveling in the costa rican rainforest for several days and my feet stay dry.
Theyre definitely comfortable and I didnt have to worry about breaking them in!
Boot fit as expected.
I have taken them out on different hikes and worn them around the house, and if I wear them for more than one hour my feet start to hurt.
I have had multiple different hiking boots and I've put hundreds of miles on my Keens and  never once did any of the other boots I have owned hurt like these do.
If these were already dirty, I would return them for a full refund.
They are the worst pair of boots I have ever owned.
Really, really bad blisters on the back of my heels.
7 was equal to 38 European so size down I guess!
It doesn't happen often so this once ?
* super painful*  the toe bed bends into a crease which digs into the top of your foot.I ordered two pairs of Columbia boots to try on, and both had the same design.
Im not really a hiking boot type of person so this was a perfect buy
After reading several reviews, I still had my doubts, but the shoe fits perfectly.
The only reason I gave these boots 1 star is because I like the way they look.
Never have I had a pair of shoes that hurt my feet so bad!!
Theyre absolutely awful!!!
Ive tried all kinds of insoles to try and make these work to no avail.
Total waste of money.
need to put insoles in it anyway  ,but it keeps my feet dry!
I barely walked around my apartment once and was getting a hotspot already.
Would not buy again.That said, I have high very high arches which may have caused some of the discomfort from the leather creasing.
After this, my hiking has never been better!
Bought size 9s and they're too roomy even with hiking socks.
Ive never had this problem with timberlands, Merrills, doc martens, etc.
SO disappointed with Columbia!
haven't had them long enough to say I love them, but I think I do :)
Just a little bit heavier than I expected, but I guess that's all hiking shoes do?
ordered a 9 for room and they fit as expected.
Unfortunately, I experienced the issue of the toebox folding inward/pressing down on my toe midstep, which I knew would leading to discomfort/blistering on a long hike.
Perfect for going out for the day and you are unsure of what the weather will bring.
I've never had a hiking boot before and the toe is very stiff.
But again I'm only used to tennis shoes.
Definitely need to be broken in before your first time use but still so comfy!
They are very light!The only downside is that the sole is slippery... I have to be very careful not to fall on my ass in rainy days!
Ms de lo que esperaba, soy talla 27MX y la talla 10US me quedaron muy bien.
Have been wearing them everyday since I bought them and did not need time to break them in.
The color is darker than I expected however very neutral and dark shows less dirt as fast!
Very disappointed!
Comfortable and had dry feet.
Kept the melty snow out, just make sure wool socks are used for cold temps.
I can walk in the rain, mud or cold weather.
Never had a chance to wear them.
Haven't used them yet lol but they fit as expected and they seem great quality.
Fits a little small, but eventually widens with use.
I tested it by stepping into all the cold water puddles I could find during a bad snow storm in Boston.
I got my regular size, which was loose enough that I can wear thick socks or even add some insoles, but was fine without as well.
I ordered them because I liked the previous pair and they lased a long time.
I have only worn cowboy boots for the past 18 years and needed something with tread for the mud.
Lo compre para un regalo, la bota viene un poco amplia pero se puede ajustar colocndole una plantilla extra, de ah en fiera muy buenas y resistente
I tried to break them in before the trip, but I was clearly unsuccessful.
The trail was 3 miles, my 5 year old did it, so its not like it was tough.
Super disappointed, will look into better boots.
They were a little snug and somewhat hard
Hiked all of Havasu falls in both rain and dry weather.
My socks stayed dried and no issues with sliding around the trail.
Only gave 4 stars because I haven't worn them on a trip yet
Wearing for work in horse arena got muddy cleaned up great.Light brushing shined with neatsfoot oil.
I have just started hiking, and although I love Keens, couldn't justify the price for a beginner.
Have weak ankles?
I got stuck in a rainstorm and they held up!
A bit stiff to break in.
A thin pad will help.
Light weight and not hard to walk in.
The problem is whenever you walk and bend the boot the top of the toe box goes straight down and crushes your toes.
I do not have fat feet and I do not have fat toes however the toe box hits my toes!
Haven't worn them yet.
The shoe is nice but it has a problem in the toes.
I bought a previous pair of 9 or 9.5 Columbia boots but they were too tight.
I haven't hiked in these yet, but they seem to fit perfectly, and I usually wear 9-9.5.
Son perfectos y muy resistentes...me encantaron
I don't have 5 more words
Definitely not worth the price.
No complaints till now.
They fit fine but not much cushion!
Well it did not snow, it rained.
The trail was muddy and long.
Takes a bit of time to wear them in and get them comfortable to your feet but otherwise thy are a great sturdy shoe and completely waterproof!
Hiked over 20 miles in them in 3 days and no blisters or discomfort!
wore them to my every single hikes since I got them almost 2 years ago.
Nice boot, but doesn't have a built in arch support.
I didn't break them in prior, and had no issues.
When I flex my foot there is a deep uncomfortable crease that presses into my toes.
Would be way too uncomfortable in the terrain I hike, but would be fine in the city or on relatively flat terrain.
Too tight even after I had them on inside and walked around.
These shoes run small.
I always fit into a size 5 but not with these shoes.
I re-ordered for a size 6 which gives me room for socks as well as a little wiggle room for hiking.
Was painful and had to return them.
They either made too much material in the from of the boot or the material is not thick enough to prevent the level of creasing that ocurred.
Would not recommend this boot.
Also went to Dicks sporting goods and tried on an 8.5 and experienced the same issue.
Felt like they were falling asleep.
I take a size 11 but ordered a 12 so that I could wear heavy socks with them.
They are good in the length, but too narrow even for medium weight socks.
I don't have a wide foot.
Also, another review mentioned it being uncomfortable when you walk because they crease across the top of your foot.
I guess these just run narrow.
These shoes run big and wide.
When I walked on them it folds and  it hurts the top of my toes.
It was not attractive to me, too bulk.
I wish I could give a good review, but I had a terrible experience, I received this item and the shoes were worn.
That is why I give this a bad review.
Looks cheap.
But it did not hold up well in snow.
My feet were cold and wet in just 15 minutes of walking in snow which was my sole purpose of buying them.
I would not recommend them for walking on snow.
I would have returned them if it wasn't too late.
First time buying hiking boots they are a little big but with wool socks im sure they will fit nice.
Exactly what i expected in quality.
It's not that the toe box is small, seems like the material doesn't have any give to it so every time I take a step the top creases and crushes my toe.
Seems they are making these not as wide as they used to be.
They fit a little small but they stretch as you break them in.
This is a very attractive and sturdy shoe, but there is a flaw in the toe box area.
I attempted to wear these shoes for a 10-mile hike, but had to stop and turn back within a mile because the constant digging from the toe crease.
I had high hopes for these shoes, but my little piggies said no.
Love these for my winter walks.
Extremely lightweight.
Have not worn them yet, but can't wait to test the waterproofness of these boots!
They were fine overall, but cut across the top of my toes with each step really painfully.
Had to return them.
Out of all of the boots, sneakers anything, I have never had a pair of boots fit me so comfortably.
Tried them on quite a few hikes now and ended up with really bad blisters.
she is not an experienced hiker, but she treked 8.5 miles, with a lot of ups and down, and she had 0 blisters.
Didn't need to break them in, did back-to-back 5 mile and 12 mile hikes over the weekend and shoes remained comfortable and my feet blister free.
Need to get wide so a tad disappointed.
Same size, same color... After 2-3 maybe more winters, I plain wore them out.
I had been disappointed in my shoe purchases lately from my regular brands.
These are not comfortable due to the ankles rubbing so badly.
Have worn them a few times and they're not even close to being broken in.
I took a chance on these hooping the toe crease issue would not be a problem...but it was.
Sizing was good and appearance nice, but the toe crease rub hurt within 1 minute if walking in them.
Everyone said to size up and theyre wrong.
Dont size up, order your normal size or they will be too big.
IN MARCH A PIECE OF THE BOTTOM SOLE TORE SO I TRIED TO RETURN/EXCHANGE BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED THEM  AMAZON WILL NOT TAKE ANY RETURNS AFATER 34 DAYS AND COLUMBIA WILL NOT WARRANTY ANY PRODUCTS NOT PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM THEM.
Listen to the other reviewers here and dont waste your time like I did.
These are useless so they are going back.
Shame because they are super cute!
I ordered a size up... 9 1/2 and the issue actually became worse.
Started to get uncomfortable after a few minutes of walking.
This is the narrowest size 11 boot I have ever tried on--it was super-painful on my foot for the 30 seconds I had it on.
I have had Columbia boots which fit me perfectly but not this one!
It also appears to be made mostly of manmade synthetic stuff NOT leather (except in tiny patches), unless the leather is coated with synthetic.
So sad because I had high hopes.
I ordered a size 7 and found the toe box to be very tight w/ lightweight wool socks.
The shoe is very stiff but fairly lightweight.
However, it felt like it would take a while to break them in.
No complaints
I didn't get the same boot in the picture.
I'm a bit disappointed as I've been trying hard to find a good boot for work that will get me through winter.
However, I only took a few steps in them before knowing that they werent going to work.
It was uncomfortable just walking around, but it would be asking for blisters and foot damage if I used them on a hike.
Had to return them.
I expected more from a brand like Columbia.
I walked all Per with them.
They seemed fine, but after 4-5 days of hiking, I have one tow nail that is about to fall off (index toe on left foot) and a blister on another toe (ring finger toe on left foot).
I had to return it twice because the sizing was all wrong.
Im a size 6, but both 6 and 5.5 was way too big.
The 5 finally fit but the shoe is built terribly - so uncomfortable, especially at the toes.
I wear them 11 to 12 hours a day.
A bit heavy for long hikes.
I love the look and color of these, but the fit is horrible!
The toe area is not made right.
The left one fit okay on the first pair I ordered, but the right was bad.
The toe area was bad on both of them on the second order.
It pushes on your toes when walking and is very uncomfortable.
Perfect fit!!!
Most hiking boots are unsightly, but these are solid without feeling clunky.
Granted, I know that my foot is a bit wide but I couldn't even get my foot into this shoe it was sooooo narrow.
Per the description they are suppose to be leather but I really have to question that, pleather maybe???
It is a sturdy hiking boot but makes a few sore spots if you wear it for long excursions.
Did not feel like the usual stiff shoe.
Unfortunately that's the only good thing I can say about them.
I wore them for less than a mile walk with my dog and within the first few steps I was already beginning to feel blisters starting.
But I would not have bought these in the first place had I known how flawed the design was.
Loved them at first however 4 mo later and they are falling apart.
I was disappointed to find out other reviewers were right about an issue with the toe box.
With every step, the middle of the top of the boot bends in to bump against your toe.
It was annoying on a test walk around my kitchen, and I can't imagine how bad it would be on an actual hike.
Las botas son muy bonitas y cmodas.
No pesan nada y son las mejores para caminatas.
I tried it on as soon as I got it and sent it back the same day.
Maybe it needed softer material as it really presses down as it bends in the front.
Pretty disappointing.
Keeps my feet dry on rainy days.
Don't not look or feel like leather.Shame on you Columbia.
I was worried i wouldnt like the grey but they go with a lot and i'm glad to have them.
Super disappointing.
Mi esposa quedo encantada de la comodidad,el ajuste, el agarre al piso, el material.
I have had these boots for less than a full year and they have not held up well.
I wish I could give this less than one star.
It fit as expected, so I went on a 3 mile hike to break them in.
I was a bit worried but figured I would just need slightly thicker socks.
Received boot and found that one of the boots had a huge lump under the sole near the ball of my foot.
Received the second pair and one of the boots had the toe are of the sole rolled under and stuck/glued in place.
Returning second pair will not try a third time.
They fell apart within 4 days of wearing them.
We did moderate, relatively flat hikes.
I thought maybe I just tripped and it was my fault.
I am so disappointed in columbia.
They feel so uncomfortable and they feel like plastic.
I am very disappointed since I thought they would be worth the price but felt like a scam.Do not buy them unless you want to have shoes that you will not use.
Walked around home with them on, just to break them in a little.
I bought the shoes to resist the cold condition and snow ground.
The shoes are very water-proof but can't  protect from cold.
They quality does not appear to be there.
I specifically ordered from Anazon (vendor) due to reviews of fakes and poor quality.
The inside feels "light" like your walking on once layer of shoe with little to no insole.
Foot part fit ok but tongue and collar were too high, rubbed on my ankle.
Could not see making a long hike in these boots.
unfortunately, after walking for a bit i noticed that as my toes bent in my stride the top of the shoe would bend and press down on my toes.
After a short while i had to go back home and change because my feet hurt so much.
Excelentes solo me habra gustado un poquito ms acochinado el taln pero no deca que as fueran.
Too small in size, not true to ratings and quality is average, expensive for the type of quality it is.Stiff and not really good quality
Kept my feet warm in negative temps!
These were supposed to last a long time and they are ripping from the sides, im really disappointed I thought i would at least have them for a while at least a year, I also noticed early on that if i happened to step in a puddle the water would go in my shoe and wet my socks
The boot bends on the top of my foot, very uncomfortable.
fast delivery, alittle discomfort as with any new shoe, great product!
Not bad in the comfort department.
I have no complants!
This past week was miserable in these boots.
The soles were weak, I felt every footstep, no cushion.
Highly disappointed my return window is closed.
Haven't tried them yet but they are nice, well made boots.
The pair I just bought has the bending-ridge-into-toe issue that a few others reported, only on the right boot.
The problem was immediately noticeably when walking around the room and I am sure would become painful hiking.
Plus these are not difficult to clean.
I wanted to love these but the weird toe box caused instant pain.
However, every time I took a step the bend of the boot would pinch my toes.
I am a landscaper, and I think I have finally found a boot that will stand up to the rigors of abuse!
I ordered 1/2 size larger than my Timberland's, and the boots are uncomfortable.
I bought these for a hiking trip and I couldn't believe how light and comfy they are when I received them.
I can't wait for all the adventure!
I've only had them a month and they're already falling apart.
I had my other boots exact type as these for 3 years before they started to fall apart.
Also, they are not waterproof.
I just missed my return window.
Very disappointed in the craftsmanship will not buy againUpdate: it's not been 5 months of owning this boot and the entire side just blew out on them.
True to size and no break in necessary.
Comfortable, never had a blister, light and very good support.
Toe crease problem is real.
Very painful.
Will be returning, which is sad because they are cute for a hiking boot.
No blisters,  no water leakage!
Unlike Merrell boots that do NOT fit true to size, these Columbia's do.
I have very narrow feet and these weren't too wide or boxy.
Boots are a bit stiff, but will probably relax eventually.
returned with no problem at all.
They where cute but way too big.
Dog made me fall in a creek and I didn't get wet.
Since it was ordered by mail , I was a little worried it wont fit .
I wear them for both on and off trail hikes.
It doesn't have enough ankle support but otherwise is comfortable .
It doesn't need breaking in  to wear it .
I can wear them all day with no pain, and they keep my feet warm and dry!!!
Even with heavy hiking socks, these were too big in the size I normally wear.
One of the boots has a security tag onVery unhappy with this issue
These boots are a little heavier than I expected, but all around, I think they are what I wanted and needed.
A little snug but some boots are cut smaller than others.
It just runs little small,so go up a half size will be perfect
Rubbed the top of my big toes when I walked.
I thought maybe they just needed to be broken in but there was no way I could keep wearing them.
Nice boots otherwise, to bad, I had to send them back.
My daughter went on a week long science trip and had only worn them once before that.
Rather narrow and stiff
Don't ignore the reviews like I did.
They aren't meant for climbing, they grip isn't all that good.
At first I thought it was because they have high ankles, so I wore high socks, but it still didn't work.
I had the worst blisters after a single hike about 5 miles long.
Same as the ones I saw at Dick's for less.
I definitely didn't hesitate to return them .
Like everyone else I had the same problem with that crease that forms right above toes only on one shoe and it hurt bad, can't imagine having to put up with that for hours it would be torture.
I have feet problems and they have not hurt my feet yet.
Now after using for a few months will have to throw away.
I love the design, but it isn't comfortable and the crease kept rubbing against the nail of my big toe.
Boot larger than expected.
However, for my surprise I didn't find that in the pair I received.of the experience.I am totally disappointed by the  experience.
These are NOT waterproof boots - I found out the hard way yesterday.
Ended a mushroom hunting session with wet socks.
Plus the toe pinching when walking is super annoying and disappointing.
I wear 8.5, but these were too big for me.
But the main problem with them is that they are hard on the back and made my legs/muscles/ tendons very sore
Bend in toe box was really uncomfortable- had to send back ( some reviewers had said this)
Las primera botas de mi esposa, para senderismo y qued fascinada.
Every time you step that seam bends down.
I have to wear band aides.
Poor design.
She went hiking when the ground was wet and her feet stayed dry.
They were comfortable, but the sole fell apart after a few times wearing them
and I wasn't using them for hiking, just every day wear -- taking the dog for a walk down the street.
Ive slipped twice on a rock, both instances on dry surfaces.
These boots are made for flat surfaces.
Complete waste of money!
Don't regret spending my money on them.
No breaking period needed.Used it to hike for 8 hours, vertically climbing mostly.
Very light and no breaking my feet either.
Even in my right size the boots were uncomfortable when stepping and I could tell I would have gotten blisters.
I feel super comfortable walking in them, plus they're cute.
Bought these boots 6 months ago and didn't begin wearing them until probably mid August.
The soles are already completely falling off and I am unable to wear them.
Super bummed ??
I walked across the floor in them and that is as far as I got.
When you walk it folds on toe which is uncomfortable.
I haven't taken these on a hike yet, but they are so comfortable to wear on a rainy day
Trying to return but barcode Will not register with the UPS store as Instructed.
Also not bad looking for a winter boot
Did an 8 mile hike in them, and was struggling.
I wear these to work and stand about 8-10 hours in them and my feet dont hurt.
But that was no problem with these.
It caused my feet to swell and they were very uncomfortable.
And its way too late for a return
Ive had them for a few months now and I dont wear them anymore because your feet will get really hot
In sorry, but the material looked cheap.
Wore in the pooring rain and feet stayed totally dry.
The foot hurts.
Creases in the toe causing it to rub on my toes which hurt a lot.
Do not buy for hiking more than 2 miles
I wore these hiking shoes TWO times before I had one of the shoe lace inserts fall off.
lightweight....
so far i like em!
I should probably wear them in first, but I like the look and fit of the boot.
No complaints yet.
These boots are not lightweight or comfortable.
Stiff and really painful in my toes...
The toe box has some serious pinch and I my foot slides around in the boot, even though my toe is almost at the front.
Too small.
Not what I expected from a Columbia product.
It's not even been a month I bought these pair of shoes and the pasting has already started to fall off....didn't expect this poor quality show from Columbia and Amazon....highly disappointed!
It was not at all comfortable.
Very narrow fit.I'm very disappointed...definitely should not be called waterproof!
Terrible for hiking in...can feel rocks and Roots way to easily...only good to wear casualy , but not in the woods!!!!
I send it back and I asked for refund but I didn't get it yet.
Disappointing as I really liked the look and general fit of these.
Extremely uncomfortable,  toebox issues, hard even with additional insert, not good for extended use.
very stiff 
Listen to the reviews about the painful toe box on this shoe!
Terribly uncomfortable.
Wore for hiking in Banff and could not even walk after the first day of wearing them.
No support - no cushion when walking.
Feet sweat terribly in them.
extremely uncomfortable, my ankles and toes bruised up at the end of every hike.
The fit is weird, if you have skinny feet like me, your feet would be swimming in this but your ankle and toes would be crushed.
Shoe dug into ankle could not wear them while hiking out west which was the whole point of purchase.
OK but seem very stiff and less comfy than merrell ones.
Despite ordering 1.5 size up still too small & heavy for hiking
The toe seam is in a really bad spot.
Rubs wrong.
These were an exchange because my first pair ordered in my regular size were too short.
Ordered 1/2 size larger which were too long.Sizing was difficult
Didn't like the fit.
These boots are not waterproof.
So for her to wear these is mildly notable so the darkness is sufficient that they are not outright brown.
pude caminar y caminar con ellas sin la ms mnima molestia desde el da uno!
These are pretty comfortable despite having limited arch support.
(Maat 40)Too small and too narrow!
Please do not sell people wrong sizes online, now it has to be sent to Germany with a self printed label!
