I'm 46 and have had some previous knee issues so I've found my footwear makes a big difference.
I wore Darn Tough wool hiking socks, and sneakers in between hikes at camp and in the car.
After returning home a month ago, I started wearing these boots for my daily walk (3 miles on pavement, presently covered with ice and snow).
The one thing I am concerned about is how water proof this pair will be.
Im an 8.5 in heels and a 9 in boots.
Just right.
I know I could wear thick socks or two pairs and still have a comfortable fit.
Arch for an average foot is comfy.
If you have high arches you will likely need an insert.
These are the most comfortable boots.
They also fit my orthotic inserts.
muy buen material
Length fits me just fine with little bit room to wiggle but the side just suffocates my foot.
Now I am debating if I should get the wide version or if I will get the half size up
These boots were perfect.
Fit as expected.
Hiked 10.7 miles total last week.
1 blister on 1.5 mile wimpy hike compared to first day and I really think it was more the socks.
2 out of 3 of us had these boots.
We dont hike enough to warrant spending $$.
I sized up a half size.
Most comfortable boots ever.
I will let you know after the hike if they kept me from falling!
These boots are really nice.
i really put these to the test on my first trip out.
We hiked through a forest burn area and waded through waist deep thick brush that was burnt...destroyed my jeans lol my boots were covered  in scratches and soot i thought i ruined them.
i wiped them off with a damp cloth and they literally looked like when i first put them on.
Beyond impressed with how these perform
I notice that when I put the extra insert into the right shoe it seems a little off.
I normally wear an 8 ordered 8.5  I use them for work and they get the job done.
I ordered this boots for my trip to Alaska.
I went ahead wearing them to break in them before I go on my trip in the summer.
Siempre me gust esta marca.
Los botines son de calidad y cmodos.
Los recomiendo
100000/10 recommend these shoes
Not really hiking yet but did some serious walking around.
Easy to clean.
Glad I figured that out before the big hike.
Im going to buy them again.
Great for flat feet with orthotics.
I returned the product.
Perfect fit.
Stylish, comfy enough- I might add an insole.
Hope to wear on vacation this early summer.
Great fit.
Waterproof just how I needed them to be!
The best boots.
Through all the mud my feet stayed dry and clean
Great fitting!
Great quality!
Fast shipping!
Impermeabili.
Ottimo acquisto.
Stra raccomandate
These shoes are more than I expected them to be!
I bought these to hike in Costa Rica.
Needed something quickly due to waterproof winter shoes destroyed by apartment mouse.
I loved climbing in them they had amazing grip also lasted my 10 mile hike up this canyon.
But will need to buy an insole since this one is so hard.
Un Excelente Producto.
Me quedaron perfectas , las use para escalar la montaa mas alta de mi pais , ni se sienten en los pies de tan comodas.
Quality
I splurged and bought these before a trip to Europe, with it being December-January I needed something comfortable and waterproof as I was going to be walking a lot and Europe knows how to let the weather rip.
I have done nothing but rave about these shoes since purchasing!
True to size.
If you dont care for the insole, try inserting your own insoles or consider wearing thicker, cushy socks.
More to come in August.
?
Chaussures une demi pointure en trop par rapport aux habituelles,
I've had these boots for 3 years and so far they are the only boots I've ever hiked in.
Icy trails will win against the boots.
Excellent rapport Qualit/Prix.De vrais chaussons !
Je recommande ces chaussures.
Still waterproof though, so I'll keep using them on shorter hikes.
Hands down my favorite hiking boots.
Definitely recommend
I purchased three different hiking boots and these were by far the most comfortable ones.
I purchased .5 size bigger and they fit perfectly.
Normally a 7 and purchased a 7.5.
They grip well and werent heavy.
Would purchase again.
Recommend!!!
Muy comodas, si las recomiendo un poco amplias perdir numero habitual
I do prefer a better insole than what comes with the shoe.
Ive done a 17 mile hike (in one day), climbed mountains, and have done lots of rainy weather hikes.
Very glad I did.
These are super comfy, I would recommend sizing up half a size.
They are so comfortable.
Went through creeks and didnt get a bit wet.
They were exactly what I was looking for!
Have had these shoes for about 4 years now.
Still sturdy!
haha
These my 2nd pair of the exact same boots from here.
Its so comfortable and amazing.
I will continue to buy them!
Not only are these things very comfortable but they are waterproof.
Well of course theyre waterproof up until the water goes up and over your ankles and into your shoes.
Lol.
Wearing these for our spring break trip to The Grand Canyon!
Get your pair now!!
Lol.
I'll probably buy a second pair in a fashion colour for the summer :)
These are comfy off the box, no need to break in and are a gorgeous brown!
Great purchase!
They are fairly comfortable.
Look okay.
Winter here is usually anywhere from 20 degrees to 40 degrees.
I love hiking and I live in the rugged Appalachian mountains.
These boots survive all of that and do well.
Ped medio nmero ms grande y considero que tengo pie ni tan delgado ni ancho.
Sin embargo s las siento bastantes justas.
No me atrev a usarlas porque tan solo al ponermelas ya siebtobque me aprietan
True to size!
Perfect for my hiking trip!
I normally wear 6.5 to 7.
I'm returning and getting the 7.
Bought these boots in a size 6.5.
Lol
Fit snug to size.
They are so comfortable.
Very nice but not for wide feet
Se volete un consiglio usate la taglia americana.
 molto pi affidabile
I'd say that's waterproof alright.
I will reccomend these to anyone and will be wearing them for all my hikes.
Botas muy cmodas, ligeras y presentables!
Cubre el taln a la perfeccin!
Der Schuh ist bequem und robust.
Nur leider ist die Innensohle kleiner als der Schuh.
Ich wrde mich freuen wenn Sie mir die passende Innensohle Grsse 39,5 noch kostenlos nachsenden wrden.
Vielen Dank schon Mal.
9/10
These boots are waterproof and highly functional,  great for my ankles.
I wear them with skirts look so cute.
Ces chaussures sont lgres, parfaites pour la marche.
Elles sont aussi impermables, trs bon achat!
They are hard inside.
Excellente chaussure de marche.Trs confortable et lgre.
Grip assur en temps humide.Prix correcte vie la qualit du produit.Chaussant du 38, j'ai prix une taille au dessus.
These boots fit comfortably.
These are a lifesaver.
I bought the black and red nubuck looking ones and the gray suede looking ones.
They make my feet look smaller and I will get lots of use out of them.
As expected.
Excelente calidad-precio
Me facinaron!
We decided to go hike Byron Glacier on a very windy & rainy day.
While on the top of the boulders, I received several urgent texts messages and luckily I had reception.
In 40 degrees of windy & down pouring rain, I ran down the boulder field, across the rocky field back to the wet and puddled trail until I reached the parking lot.
It was a blur.
Once the emergency was completely addressed.
These shoes held up.
I ran & stepped through puddles and thick mud and my feet stayed warm & dry.
No breaking in period.
Wore them for up to 10 mile hikes in a day.
I am purchasing a second pair just in case they are discontinued.
(boulder field to give an idea of the terrain and the actual)
The color are exactly as shown.
Maybe a smaller size couldnt fit on me.
Great quality!!!
I also walk in all weather.
In general, I wear an 8.5 shoe if the shoe is true to fit.
So few are.
Therefore I ordered a size 9 and discovered that yes, the 9 was slightly large.
Fast forward about 6 weeks and I feel the boot has formed more to my foot.
I also would recommend that if you use them in the summer, you use them in cooler climates.
Just be careful about the sizing and the conditions.Update:.
I did use waterproofing spray to help lengthen the waterproofing, but this year the boot leather is cracking.
These boots are very comfortable and so light.
Love the boot but, I normally ware 8 1/2 - 9.
So, if youre sometimes between sizes I would go up the 1/2 size.
These boots fit exactly as i had hoped.
I ordered 1/2 size larger than my standard street shoe b/c I always do with boots and sneakers.
Perfect fit.
Wore them on trails recently, right out of the box.
No breaking in was necessary.
I've had them for 4 wks.
I know Columbia is a great brand but got these because they are my work colors (black & red).
They are holding up great being worn everyday and have great traction.
I got these in the mail about 3 days prior to my hike.
(Normally 6.5, ordered a 7.
Final verdict: I took these shoes out to hike a 14er (Quandary Peak) and they performed fabulously!
( I did notice a bit of rubbing around the ankles a bit on the descent but I just put on a bandaid.
No blisters.
.
I've been wearing these on shorter walks around town in order to 'break them in' and see how they fair before some longer hikes planned later in September.
There was an easy fix however.
I just place a band-aid on both ankles in the spot that rubs before walking and it seems to have fixed the issue.
I love love love these shoes.
I originally bought my normal size, 9.5.
After a couple days of walking around the house, it was clear that I needed to size up.
I returned the 9.5 and bought size 10.
I was researching for a wide foot boot and came across this boot.
I ordered a size up to allow room for expansion and I am glad I did this.
I ordered a pair of the same type of shoe last week, and it fit perfectly.
This pair is much smaller.Same size
Ordered a size 10 and it fits perfectly!
Will likely order another pair I like it so much!
I wore these for a week hiking on various trails in the Blue Ridge mountains.
More than once on a rocky trail I was afraid I had injured my ankle.
I will absolutely go back to those at the first chance I get.I almost feel like it needs another lace hook at the very top.
Cool purple tread.
Good support and look nice too
I bought these hiking boots in lieu of snow boots for the Tahoe trips I took this year.
My feet weren't even sore by the end of the day, and they sure stayed dry even when sloshing through puddles and crunchy, deep snow.I'll update this review if anything changes, but until then, the main takeaway is that for a casual hiker that wants a multi-purpose boot, these are wonderful value, quality, and comfort for the price!
ok gzel bir rn memnun kald?m
As I walk, the tops put pressure and bruise my ankles.
I'm a make-sure kind of gal.
I also had on Frogg Togg rain pants.)
But because of these reviews, I expected it.
I wear a size 5, sometimes smaller.
With the exercise of walking a lot, at one point my feet got so hot I had to change shoes
fortunately I had brought others after reading some people found them hot.Thank you for the reviews!!
Anfangs hatte ich ein relativ gutes Tragegefhl... mittlerweile kann ich nach mehrmaligen Spaziergngen sagen, dass der Schuh auf nassen Wiesen NICHT wasserdicht ist.
Auerdem schmerzen inzwischen die Fe, da der Schuhe wohl zu steif ist.
Schade :-(
Very lightweight, great color.
Would suggest wearing taller socks or pants that cover your ankles, just so the material doesnt rub against your leg during your hike.
Stay in place, could have gotten a half size smaller for length aspect of fit, but the shoe stays in place without issue
They're comfortable for day hikes and everyday wear.
I really like it.
I wear a size 9.5-8.5 shoe.
Usually 9.5 for running shoes, 9 for normal shoes and 8.5 for flats or heels.
I ordered a 9.5 first.
I was not happy.
I cant wait to use them to hike and walk the dogs.
The exchange process was super easy luckily.
***2nd Update- it's been 3 years and these boots are still going strong!
My sneakers gave me blisters halfway through Day 1.
**Update- Well, I've had these for seven months and they've become my everyday work shoe.
I originally bought them for a month-long trip to Europe
When I got home from the trip, I started wearing them to work.
I love that they give so much support without looking like a clunky hiking boot.
I can't recommend this enough, best purchase of 2017.
I like them.
I can keep these on for long periods of hiking.
If they had cushioning like Hokas, I'd be in love (these were about $130 cheaper than Hoka boots)
These shoes have been a really good purchase for me.
They fit and they are comfortable.
Great purchase.
I'd buy them again if needed.
No break in love this boot
I dont know if it is the boot, or just the shape of my foot.
In either case it appears that I am returning to the good old drawing board.
Not the easiest shoe to put micro spikes on in freezing weather, but works.
Resistant against the mud and supportive.
tirn de orejas a Amazon.
La talla la esperada.
Muy cmodas y s son impermeables.
Valen cada peso.
I bought them to wear on my trip to Ireland.
We did alot of walking in Galway .
The boot provided good support going over miles of jagged rocks on the way see: the famous worm hole and the Dun Angus fort on Innishmore n the Cliffs of Moher.
I reccomend the boot.
Second Pair.
As soon as you put them on you are good to go, unbelievable for a boot, no break-in!
:)
Nice casual boot for running errands and more.
I like these boots so much I bought a second pair.
Comfortable from day 1.
However I decided to keep the 10 and send back the 10.5
Five stars wouldve been a slightly more refined (fluffy and less clunky) interior and better gripping soles.
The first time I wore them, I took them on a 3 hour trail walk.
I also wore them for a 4 days trip in the Yosemite Valley, in the winter.
They kept my feet warm (with appropriate stockings) and dry in both rain and snow.
I have a medium width foot and these are perfectly fitted, maybe a little too fitted with thick socks
I just love them more and more.
Pictures are taken recently.
Ordered this the same time I ordered 2 other brands.
I was looking for work boots for outside.
I added inserts because on feet constantly and plenty of room without being tight.
Great boot.
Me compre estas botas hace unas semanas.
Las use para senderimos y fueron perfectas.
Pero si pude ver la diferencia en su funcin durante una caminata de senderismo y una escalda y definitivamente son para sendererismo.
parfait, bon produit et livraison dans les dlais
Not that that's news to anyone.
It's either pick a brand and stick with it or just constantly have to try on everything.
I've had to return 3 pairs of shoes.
That was a different brand.
They were massive.
I'm giving this item four stars.
One less only because the description for sizes, which says I'm a 6.5 which I've never been except occasionally (and I mean very occasionally) for an extremely dainty lady shoes.
I bought a whole size up from what the website described.
What's a girl to do?
times until I could find the right size.
But a mother who works can really appreciate the help.
Thank you Amazon/Columbia!
Columbia is a trusted brand in my book.
I've always ordered a half size up to accommodate heavier socks for the colder weather.
Wore them today for the first time on my regular three mile morning walk with my dogs and it was pouring rain the whole way.
Confortable since the very first time.
I use them for long walking sessions with my dog.
I have hiked almost 1200 steps (4.5 miles) in one day.
I purchased the black version.
It is beautiful and fashionable.
Good to go for general walks in as well.
We went to Arizona, Utah, Nevada
the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree, Zion, Salt Lake.
My friend had some HiTech hiking boots and she said these Columbia boots were a lot lighter than hers.
They were so extremely comfortable and easy to walk in.
I have hiked all over Colorado and all the way across the Grand Canyon and I LOVE these boots.
These hiking boots were great for an outdoors vacation that was often rainy.
(Note: My shoe size ranges between an 9.5 and a 10.
I first bought these in a 9.5 after looking at the size chart, but I hadnt taken the inside padding into consideration.
The 9.5 size was too small, but the 10 is perfect, so if youre unsure which size to get, I suggest going with the larger one.)
They didnt hurt my feet at all during my first time wearing them!
And theyre waterproof, so I had fun splashing in some puddles!
They will also be super easy to clean if I get mud or dust on them, since the outside material is like a plastic-y texture (Im not sure exactly what it is.)
They aren't comfortable.
I would advise those who want Columbia quality to go to the Columbia site.
I did a hike of 27 miles, all the way to Pikes Peak.
I just received these boots today-they came in exactly 2 days  as promised so that was great since we are going on a big hike tomorrow.
Maybe once I start walking and they break in I will feel some bounce.
My other ones were so comfortable and lasted almost 8 years.
They are like walking on a cloud.
The first time I wore these I climbed Mt. Ha Ling in Alberta in March.
Around 7500ft and minus 30 at the top, all snow and ice.
I did ALOT of research before buying and I first bought size 7 but exchanged for size 7.5 (I recommend sizing up by a half!)
.
I was willing to spend hundreds of dollars to avoid getting cold but Im SO glad I went with these!
Me encantaron estas botas para viajar, son ligeras y se ve que resisten mucho todos los elementos.
Muy recomendadas.
I figure they will hold two more strong hikes and then fall apart eventually.Conclusion: Great value for the price.
I searched multiple stores and tried on over 15 different hiking boots in multiple sizes and styles.
I have a large toe box, band it gave my feet plenty of space, yet it was also supportive for my arches.
Hab sie jetzt das zweite Mal zum wandern angehabt.
Kein Drcken, kein Zwacken.
Super dicht und bequem.
Liebe sie
I just bought my second pair of these boots.
I hope they don't!
I really, really like these boots.
I also had chaffing  where the boot upper edge rubbed  on my lower leg.
I never thought 1 size down would  make such  a difference.
I'm so happy these  came in my size, and didn't  have to go to men's boots.
The Columbia brand seems to have lost quality over the years.
They fit as expected ??
They are thick enough that I feel I have at least some protection against the rattlesnakes.
If you can buy them for under $100 I'd say go for it.
I am new to hiking and researched several brands and types of hiking boots before purchasing these.
Im very pleased!
I wore wool hiking socks and my feet were comfortable the whole time with no issues.
I did read the reviews about the toe box issue so was aware I may experience the same
I can definitely see what people are talking about but it was not an issue for me and the shoe did not rub my toes at all.
Maybe its because I ordered a half size up?
Im looking forward to hiking in them in 2021!
Im just use it for my trip to Iceland.
.
These boots were exactly what I needed!
As other reviews have said, the toe box does feel tight but only with initial use.
Now, over 6 months later, everything feels great and no toe box concerns at all.
I would descibe them as entry level walking boots
I bought these to hike in the Galpagos Islands.
Great purchase.
Too hot
They're a bit tighter, and stiffer than my previous pair.
I bought the dark brown 4ish years ago.
The grey pair seems smaller and stiffer.
The first was made in Vietnam, and the second in China.
I wore them around the house for 2 weeks then took a short 5 mile break-in hike this past weekend.
My first pair of hiking boots were perfect.Bought them for my vacation in Colorado.
bien todo
I love the Columbia brand.
I bought them for a trip to Alaska and worked perfect.
Er ist zudem relativ leicht und lsst sich wegen des Glattleders gut pflegen.Optisch sieht er etwas zu sehr nach Kunststoff aus, aber das ist eher nebenschlich.
grer bestellt, was sich als richtig erwiesen hat.
Danke an dieser Stelle...
If both shoes felt the same size, I would have kept them.
I feel safer wearing the boots instead of sneakers .
I bought these boots in December of 2020 to wear to work so my feet would stay warm and dry.
Being hiking boots, I also got them so that I would be comfortable wearing them for 8
hours a day being on my feet most of that time.
I work 5 days a week so they saw quite a bit of use.
For how expensive they are, I expected them to last more than half a year.
Had a pair that lasted me 5
Wore them every day for a week riding and fishing in Colorado this summer.
I was glad I read previous reviews.
The shoes came on time with shipping but when I opened them, and tried them on.
They fit great.
I double checked and I got them brand new.
These boots are great!
My feet feel supported!
My feet feel happy and cushioned (under about 15 miles, after that I admit they start feeling bumpy rocks and such but thats not really the boots fault).
The first pair lasted me almost a year and I estimate I hiked 300 miles.
This is the third pair of these light weight hiking boots I've bought.
I'm a medievac helicopter pilot in Colorado and fly and land all over the state.
These are perfect for light weight, not too warm, waterproof, good sole and tread.
I'll definitely be getting more pairs as I wear the soles down.
.
y resultaron ser duros y tiesos.
Me temo que los voy a devolver ya que solo me los puse para probarlos y me lastim mucho los pies.
Los que me prob en la tienda reconfortaron mis pies, todo lo contrario a stos.No los quiero.
.
I tried the boots once when the package arrived but didnt put them on til the day of the hike.
Well, if you do the loop at Old Rag, it ends up being quite challenging.
Bouldering, hiking, stepping on water, etc..
I bought these last minute for a hiking trip.
At first I thought it was going to be a tight fit but nope!
There are lots of elevation changes.
Just a factor in their sizing.
After a week of walking, they're both comfortable, but as importantly, completely waterproof.
I am a medium width and usually wear a 9 in a dress shoe and 9.5 in an athletic shoe.
Sneakers were hurting my legs and feet so I tried these boots and now I am pain free!
I've been wearing them for a couple of months now.
Good on snow too.
These hikers are a dream.
They hold up in all types of terrain.
They are comfortable and light.My feet are "combination last" so I need this type of fit.
They are medium at the front and narrower towards the heel.
Lo compre para un regalo y qued encantada le qued muy bien,  la numeracin es correcta.
Buensimas botas, las recomiendo y las compraria nuevente
This was my second pair of these boots.
They are super lightweight and comfortable.
Ive only used them for a walk in the rain and havent taken them to a proper hike yet, but Im impressed.
I accidentally ordered a 8.5 instead of a 8, and it seems theyre exactly half a size bigger, which means theyre true to size.
Maybe Ill replace them or buy one of these shoe lace pins.Overall - love them!
Great fit!
I thought I was gonna have to send back but I wore them twice and now comfy as ever.
They ruff n rugged like I like but still girly and feminine.
Happy with my price too around $70 or so.
I always go up half a size from my sandals and dress shoes to my sneakers and boots.
Una vez usadas, me quedaron aproximadamente un nmero grande, usualmente soy 25.5 y las ped 26 por el grueso de la calceta que se utiliza para alta montaa pero an con esta me quedaban enormes, lo resolv ponindoles plantillas.
Las he ocupado para hacer rutas en el Iztaccihuatl, lo que implica piedras, lodo y nieve y en ningn momento se humedeci o me lastim el pie.
It was perfect- without breaking in!!!
Not sure how to fix it.
I usually wear a 10, but followed advice to order a half size up and ordered 10.5 and they fit great!
I love that the laces have the hooks past the ankle, no need to fight to loosen laces when you're tired since they come right off after unlacing the hooks.
I love the way the tops support your ankles from the side but don't go up as high in the back, allowing more free movement without fear of rolling your ankle.
They are very comfortable.
They also have room for the toes to spread when climbing.
They are the first hiking boots I ever owned despite being an avid hiker and I wish I had bought them before.
My size is 38 (7) and I bought 7 and they fit perfectly.
I am a size 6.5 and ordered a size 7 (since I was planning on wearing them with thick socks).
.)
:)
I bought these shoes for my sister for Christmas in 2020 for work.
She is a water plant operator and is in concrete floors for her 12 hr shifts.
I'm getting ready to order her a new pair.
They have held up well and she says they give her feet the much needed support that she needs.
I wore them around the house and noticed it immediately and was concerned it was going to be an issue but after a bit I stopped noticing it and it hasnt been an issue at all.
These are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I own and i have been wearing them as my daily run around shoes.
I wore these for the first time hiking in Yosemite.
10 out of 10 would buy them again!
Comfortable and lightweight.
I LOVE these hiking boots.
I even wore them under my wedding dress for our photoshoot being we did some hiking.
I like the comfort of the 10.5 but probably could have gone with the 10 being the ones I got have some room in front of my toes.
(Photos from our Instagram page  @shannonxaaron)
They were comfortable from day 1 but wearing thicker, hiking socks helped.
I wear them hiking on the trails and around town on snowy days.
I bought the black ones and they are always filthy after hiking but since they are waterproof they are easy to clean or rinse off.
True to size too.
Probably best for narrow feet
Ma deuxime paire de Colombia en 5 ans, jadore le fit, elles sont durable, confortable et styles.
Je recommande vraiment!
I have to say, so far, they really are water proof.
Thinking of ordering another pair for hiking and going to town, horseback riding etc.
Hope they hold up.
These boots keep my feet nice and warm and dry.
I wear a size 7.5M, and it was suggested that I order a size 8, which I did.
A few people have written about the toe crease issue.
I experienced the same thing for the first mile walking in these boots.
Amazing and overall 5/5!
Background: I work at a dog boarding facility, where I'm always on feet.
Whether it's 15 or 60 degrees, snowing, raining or sunshine, my dogs and I are out in it.
I like the mid-rise, not only does it provide a little extra support, but also keep ankle biters away from my ankles (just kidding!)
.
Botas q estn en perfecto estado y el talle queda impecable!
Todo perfecto!
??
These are probably one of the best and most useful purchases I have ever made on Amazon.
Ive went on 3 hikes so far and these boots have kept my feet dry and comfortable.
Queste scarpe sono molto belle ma sono fatte di un materiale estremamente rigido e duro.
Quando si piega il piede si crea una piega che scende e trancia le dita ad ogni passo, e non  piacevole.
Nel complesso comunque c' di meglio in giro.
If you are an extreme hiker, maybe something more high-end would be better.
I searched multiple websites and brands for hiking boots after I came back from my trip from Zion & Bryce Canyon.I love Columbia and read all of the mixed reviews for these boots.
These boots are perfect- immediately out of the box they are comfortable and feel very durable on my feet and 'airy and light' like Im wearing a pair of sneakers but feel sturdy like a pair of doc marten work boots.
I will update this review again after I come back from my camping on Santa Cruz Island.Update 5/6/2019- I wore these boots to go camping on Santa Cruz Island this past weekend.
Very comfortable and durable.
I had to wear the hiking boots several times before writing an honest review.
I thought it was my socks so I bought a new pair.
What I did differently this time than what I did the last few times was I made sure my shoes were secured from toe to ankle.
The insoles seem to be comfortable but I dont use those as I use orthotics which fit perfectly in my hiking boots.
But remember I took our my insoles our and replaced with my orthotics.
These hiking boots are fabulous if you walk for exercise.
I walk 4.5 miles 5 to 6 days a week and just purchased my 2nd pair.
Je mets 4 au lieu de 5 toiles parce que je les ai juste essay et pas encore fait de randonne.
J'ai trs hte !
Je viendrai vous redonner des nouvelles aprs ma premire randonn !
Mais pour l'instant, pour le prix, trs bonne qualit et paraisse de bonne qualit !
Very impressed and will buy them again!
Bought this shoes for a hiking trip.
I went hiking for over 7hrs in a row.
This boots were more than comfortable.
I am a size 8 regular and size 8.5 running shoe.
I was hesitant to buy shoes online so I went to a sporting goods store to try these on.
I will continue to break them in and hopefully take them on some longer hikes in a few weeks, I'll update this review when I get a chance.
Whatever the case, you save almost thirty dollars buying these on amazon versus in stores!
I will keep these for potentially wettish hikes, but I'm going to search for lighter hiking shoes.
Liam wanted to play in the water so they got wet- but my feet stayed dry inside.
I want to snag another pair when there is a sale!
Every shoe, boot, snowboard boot, or sandal I own is a size 8.
So I purchased a size 8 in these boots.
I wore hiking socks (moderate thickness) and took them on a two mile test hike when I first got them.
Right away I noticed that the toe box was creasing and hitting the tops of my toes.
They are pretty water resistant.
Measuring my foot as mentioned would have had me wearing a size 9 -10.
(I usually wear between an 8-9.)
I ordered a few pairs a couple different times, and ended up with a size 7.
I am an 11.5 W / 10 M and I ordered the size 12.
Normally, when buying boots I have to get mens sizes, and the width is way too big (makes me look like I have clown shoes).
Chaussures pour ma femme, prendre une demi taille en dessous de sa taille habituelle.
Chausures trs confortables ds le 1er jour de marche, maintient bien la cheville, trs bonne qualit.
Petit bmol, il faut impermeabimiser souvent.
Vienen un poco grandes, tal vez comprara medio nmero abajo pero con unos calcetines gruesos se arregla.
Muy cmodas.
These boots are sturdy.
I have the black ones, but they are my second pair.
No arch support so I added an insert with an arch and a heel cup because of plantar fasciitis.
Now I need  to use them for hiking Rocky Miuntains trails.
I hike in Sequoia/Kings National Parks approximately once per month and needed some water-proof boots.
I wore them for the first time this weekend on an 8-mile hike.
They provided great support too.
I also had to walk through several small streams (rock hopping, but inevitably I stepped in the water multiple times out of necessity to get across).
My feet stayed dry the whole time.
 la terza volta che ordino questo prodotto, speranzosa ogni volta di poter ricevere il mio prodotto.3 ordini effettuati del numero 41, arrivate per 3 volte il numero 39.
Merito delle spiegazioni, sembra una presa in giro.Sono senza parole.Sconsiglio a tutti questi prodotto
I am a true size 6, and all the reviews said to order up 1/2 a size.
I didnt have that option since there wasnt a 6.5 available so I got the 6.
I still have plenty of room that I can double up if need be
Fantastic purchase.
5 ?
These boots were exactly what I needed!
i really like these shoes.
they give my ankles just a little more support.
they seem to be waterproof.
looking back i should have gotten them in the wide option.
i have custom insoles that take up space in the toe box.
but that is on me.
next time ill just order them in wide for that extra room.
?
I honestly did not think about my feet at all- a true testament to these boots!
I'm usually a true size 7 and size 7 for these fit perfectly.
Since that first day, they have been on several 10
I'm size 9.5 and I don't say that often, so it's noteworthy.
They are plenty large for thick hiking socks.
They're very light and comfortable.
There was not really a break in period, but they do continue to get more comfy every day.
Muy buen calidad
I LOVE these boots!
Fits true to size with normal socks on.
Like others, I read tons of reviews on this pair of shoes as well as other hiking boots.
Im usually a 9, but ordered a 9.5.
The whole reason I bought these was to do some hiking in Colorado.
We hiked some trails in the Rocky Mountain National Park in the snow and also hiked up Horsetooth Mountain.
I'm always a size 9.
Ordered size 9 in black.
That's why some reviewer mentioned the toes are pinched by top of the shoes when bending.I ened up reorder 8.5 in tan color.
Because my size out of atock in black.
Not touching the front of the shoes.
My feets did not complaint at all!!!
Good traction and arch support.
Las quiero para viajar porque realizar un viaje para hacer senderismo.
Las botas estn cmodas y ligeras.
LOVE THEM!
I went to az and hiked up mountains.
Goldstrike, so you have to repel down and have good grip.
These did it for me.
Trenched thru water and didnt even feel a drip.
I have narrow feet and found no issues with width.
I could see if you have a wide and thicker foot they may be tight.
I didnt experience what other reviewers wrote about the front creasing and causing pain where it bends at the toes.
The laces SUCK!
Overall, glad I had these for my tip to Iceland, very comfortable and no blisters or aching feet.
Love.
They fit great.
Only issue is the shoe strings.
I work outside off-trail a lot and this terrain has lots of smilax and blackberry canes, things with thorns.
The thorns stick in them and pull and unravel.
*5 Month UPDATE*Dropped rating from 2 to 1 star.
Don't buy!
I wish I read deeper into the reviews on these boots.
By the end of the day my socks are completely damp.
I will probably go with a brand other than Columbia for my next pair of boots.
Size fits alittle tighter then my other Columbia boots.
There was a heavy frost that melted during my hike but my feet stayed warm and dry.My feet are slightly wide, but even with a thick hiking sock I had plenty of room in the toe area.
I went on a 6 mile hike the day after they arrived and I was shocked at how comfortable they are.
I ended up putting 20
I'm talking 20
They got the job done in Colorado :)
Great hiking boots.
These lived up to other reviews, which was a huge win for me!
We went hiking up in northern wisconsin, well, stayed in a cabin and it is already mid fall there.
They are durable, anti slip and waterproof!!
Did some walking at Bryce Canyon National Park, watched the sunrise in 15? with windchill factor putting temps at 3?.
My feet were nice and warm.
They clean up very easily and are waterproof.
Still space to wear thicker socks if needed.
Not heavy on feet.
I didnt want anything heavy that would weigh my legs down.
These were ideal.
The fit.
The style.
I had to add a thin Dr. Scholls pad which made the comfort even better.
Super happy.
I did get a blister even with thick boot socks.
They fit great and look great too
For walking.
They offered a W in 9 so I went ahead and ordered a 9W and returned the 9.
PERFECT.
All I needed, and they fit great!
I deliver newspapers and I'm constantly on my feet.
Can't wait to go hiking now!!
I LOVE these boots, I purchased them because they were a reasonable price and I needed new hiking boots for a trip to Alaska.
I ignored the reviews and figured I would make my own judgement call.
Muy cmodas se utiliza para caminar ????
But WOW was I happy about these boots!
These shoes had a great grip and I didn't slip at all.
I felt super powerful and sturdy.
Vivo en el campo y necesito botas que aguanten mojarse.
Me veo en la necesidad de comprar otro par porque tuve un accidente y mi bota se rompi pero protegi mi pie as que definitivamente comprar otro par.
We did 3 days of LONG hikes and a crazy incline.
I have a narrow pair of feet and bought half size bigger fits perfect.
They are definitely waterproof as I have stood in about 4 inches of water with no problem and no wetness!
I wear a 6.5-7 in shoes depending on fit and ordered these in a 7 and they fit just right
True to size.
Attractive.
These boots have gotten good reviews.
Uncomfortable the minute I put them on.
Columbia for the win!
LOVE these!
Out of the box comfortable!
Wore them first for a long rainy day with cub scouts at camp.
Ive never really been into hiking, but my partner is.
So I begrudgingly go along, but in tennis shoes like an idiot.
These boots are EVERYTHING!
I love hiking now.
Stop being an idiot and by these boots.
I like them feels good on my feet
I bought these boots for our vacation to Arizona for hiking.
We did a few hikes in Sedona with one of them being Cathedral Rock.
They were very comfortable, too.
I wear a 10 medium and I bought a 10 medium and they fit perfectly.
So many tie shoes have poor laces.
I bought these boots for a trip to Peru where I knew we would be doing lots of walking/hiking.
The day We actually went to Machu Picchu, after some time I did start to feel that pinch others described in reviews.
It did go away if I slid my foot around in the boot due to the slight wiggle room the boot had.
I do recommend if youre thinking about these to try them out.
I go on walking trails a lot need something cozy
I bought these for my backpacking trip in New Hampshire.
I went hiking in them this past Saturday (2/22) in upstate New York  IN 2-3 FEET OF SNOW.
The fit is super awesome.
I wear a size 11 and ordered a size 11
I found them true to size.
I also loved the color I purchased as I know it will match multiple different outfits.Very sturdy, and comfortable.
These boots were perfect for a family vacation to Zion and Bryce with some moderate hikes.
Hence the water is pouring in.
Not recommended for snow and river hikes.
I wore these without really breaking them in for a 9 mile, 11,000 feet hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park (I also got engaged in them - yay!!)
I'm a 7.5 and thought the size was just right.
The shoes are sturdy, comfortable and if they can last for a beginning hiker on a "hard" trail, they should be good for anyone.I would highly recommend these and can't wait to wear them again!
Love these shoes so far!!!
That was an issue with my last pair.
My toes started to feel blistered as I would walk back from hikes before.
Also very grippy on rocksChanged to 4 starts because the shoelaces keep coming untied as I walk.
I wear a size 10 and ordered a 10, and most of the dimensions were correct, but the top of the toe kept digging in uncomfortably.
.
I work 10 to 12 hours shifts in a poultry plant.
Comfort of a tennis shoe, but the durability of a wool boot!
I read the reviews where people said that they are so warm.
Well hiking in the snow when the temps.
I do like the boots
they are very comfortable.
Wear these boots to work delivering mail.
She has got a pair like this three years ago and this is the very first pair that lasts her more than a year.
Now she wanted a new pair.
Mostly waterproof .
I bought a size 8, the same size I am in sneakers.
I typically wear a 7.5 in other leather non-hiking shoes.
I would buy them again tomorrow if anything happened.
.
She sent me a photo of them on the same day they arrived.
If you are in a budget and need something reliable for hiking I would recommend these pair of boots.Not sure if they are waterproof yet but will update whenever I test them on water.UPDATE July 2017I went hiking on snow and after 3 hours the water made its way into my shoes.
I have had no blisters or irritation
Sized up to a 10 from 9.5 to accommodate thicker hiking socks for cooler months.
Would recommend your true size!
Width was a little narrow.
They also felt a bit heavy.
Then I ordered a size 11.
This time it gave me that extra room I needed to wear them with wool socks
Excelente relacin calidad precio debido a que el precio de compra estaba ofertado
so glad i got them i might buy another pair.
Purchased these to go hiking in Sedona and Grand Canyon.
Wore the first time on a 6 mile hike.
They're so comfy, I use them daily when walking the dog in our beautiful off road areas & I  often forget I have them on
I ordered a 7 and they fit great.
It has all the features I was looking for.
.
La mejor compra que he hecho en mucho tiempo!
100% recomendadas
At my job, I'm constantly walking on wet floors.
I've always preferred boots when I work because ankle support is crucial for me.
Wish I would have bought these to begin with.
?
I bought these for my job where I am on my feet all day in barn conditions.
That is the same trip I bought them for.
Have encouraged my traveling companion to get them as well.
Can't wait to use them.
I even ran a little bit in them, no discomfort at all.
The tread is still PERFECTLY in tacked even with all the climbing on rocks I do.
Excellentes bottes de marche.
Lgres et confortables.
Elles sont trs adhrentes sur la glace et la neige et je les porte mme quand il fait -15 degrs lors de mes marches rapides
DO NOT BUY THESE
I am a ladies size 12, so it is sometimes hard for me to find shoes.
I have used these boots on an 11 mile hike and a 6 mile hike.
I am going to buy something.
:)
I have a wide foot and typically wear between a 9 and 10 depending on the shoe.
I ordered a 9 wide and they fit perfectly.
I have 3 hikes o them for about 12 miles.
I had a 6.5 mile hike in damp conditions due to rain the day before and I didnt slip once.
These were comfortable right out the box.
I would recommend.
I bought a 6, as I typically hover between a 5.5 and 6.
I wanted to make sure I could wear good socks with these.
These are good for walks with my daughters or hikes with my husband in the fall or spring when snow comes and goes.
My feet feel great with out blisters or sore spots.
Trs confortable et chaude  du -25 pour marcher en ville  et monter des montagnes.
J'ai toujours eu froid au pied l'hiver mais pas du tout avec ceux-l.
I live in a wet place so waterproof walking shoes are essential.
These are nice looking (I bought the black with red), true to size fit and don't need breaking in.
Used these after being recommended by a friend for the first time for Zion & Bryce Canyon National Parks.
We walk on pretty rough terrain everyday and lately whenever I stepped on anything my ankle would "roll over".
I picked this one because the laces went all the way to the top instead of having Velcro at the top.
I have narrow width feet and these fit well!
I typically wear a size 6, and the size 6 was the right size for me in these boots.
Compared to the ariat Terrain boots in size 6, these fit narrower and adjust down tighter.
Would recommend for those with narrow feet
One thing though, these shoes get REALLY hot if you leave your feet in direct sunlight.
Also the inside does get pretty smelly but that could just be me lol.
True to size.
Just be sure to double sock!
I got a blister the one time I didnt.
Runs about a half-size large.
I purchased the oiled leather because they are sturdy and waterproof holding up better than mesh or nylon.
This was a great investment.
Since it's still early in the summer there is still snow in the mountains, but these kept my feet dry!
Even when when I was knee deep in snow.
Great quality and style!!!
I typically wear 10.5-11, depending on the shoe.
I ordered the size 11 after reading the reviews.
This was one of two hiking boots I bought for my wife and the lighter of the two.
These boots are well designed for both backpacking and day hiking on any terrain.
Inexpensive2.
Lightweight4.
WaterproofCONS:1.
Limited for deep snow conditions2.
Casual.
Easy to slip on and off.
Comfortable.
Too early to review.
Definitely recommend
I needed comfortable boot for work that didn't need to be steel toed.
These boots are super comfty even in the hot weather.
These boots were super sturdy during our end of winter hike through Sequoia and Yosemite.
If the laces were longer, I feel like they could be tied more tightly.
This is my second pair of Columbia Newton Ridge Hiking boots.
My first pair was bought in 2015 and we are now near the end of 2019 I needed another pair of hiking boots.
The ones I currently have been worn in rain, snow, good weather and bad.
I usually wear trail running shoes when hiking, but wanted a real boot to go hiking in the Alps.
Didn't slip or trip or twist and ankle once.
Ped medio nmero ms, pero vienen bn en talla.
Espero estn cmodos.
Me encantaron
My feet were supported, stayed warm at night and did in fact protect from water while I had to cross the river in them.
I would recommend for any level of hiking.
Id youre wearing for fashion and dont plan on wearing for extended periods, you might be able to get away with ordering your true size.
I wore them for work because I was looking for a sneaker feel in a waterproof hiking boot.
El talle es el mismo que uso siempre 9.5, fue perfecto, sin ningun tipo de falla.El envo fue rpido.
Muy recomendable.
Best hiking boot ever!
Maybe it works for people with wide feet.
Estaba buscando unas botas de campo y estas me gustaron mucho por su precio, esttica y especificaciones.
Sucede que en este tipo de zapatos, normalmente soy medio nmero menos.
I was very pleased.
They are indeed waterproof, comfortable and they do a very good job of supporting my ankles on rough rocky terrain.
And they look good too!
Excelente calzado y comodidad.
Muy feliz de haberlas comprado aca
Comfortable and my feet feel protected.
Shocking white compared to the black of the boot.
Need to figure out a way to fix this without damaging my boots...
I bought these for my daughter.
She LOVES them.
Since these are hiking shoes, we went up half a size to give room for heavy socks.
(Note: These shoes could best be called water resistant, not water proof.
I plan on buying another pair, this time for myself.
They are true to size.
What if it's raining because someone started a game of jumanji and you're just tromping through the woods asking to be eaten by the jumanji lion?
No thanks.
All in all I really do love these boots.
Oh!
My first hiking boots ever.
Yeeey.Love it!
I went on a last minute trip to Colorado for hiking.
I didnt even have to break the shoes in!
As a person who is prone to sprained ankles.
These saved my life !
I'm usually a 9 or 9.5 so ordered both.
The 9 fit great.
I like the fact that I took a chance purchasing the size I normally wear, a 7.5.
And with that, I still need 2 socks to keep my toes from hitting the front so abrupt while going down hill.
Any suggestions would help.
These little hiking boots were AWESOME!
I purchased them for my backpacking trip to the Tetons.
I broke them in a little bit by going on several smaller hikes for a couple weeks before I went on my trip.
They ROCKED for the whole duration of my trip.
Not me.
BEST $70 purchase EVERRRR!
I am SO glad I got them.
:D
I should have read the reviews more carefully.
Wish I could have been one of the lucky ones whose toes escaped the wrath of the crease.
:(
Our first hike where I was able to wear these boots included a waterfall and creek crossings.
My feet were completely dry when I returned to the car which makes them worth every penny to me!
I usually wear an 8 in boots.
It was hard to get the shoe on but once I did my heel lifted anytime I took a step.
The toe box was tight in the width.
However towards the front of the shoe near the bridge it caves in anytime I took a step and put pressure on my toes .
It would fold in at a sharp angle and dig into the top of my toes.
I felt the issue as soon as I took several steps.
I took these boots to Sedona, Arizona.I got the black ones size 8 they fit perfectly!
They are waterproof, they are comfortable and they protected my feet from a large amount of hot water
I bought these boots for hiking next spring and I thought I'd break them in.
Had amazing ankle support to navigate the rocks of various sizes and fit perfectly.
Amazing!
I bought these boots to replace a much more expensive pair of Vasque that totally were trashed after a year.
I have hiked in them every day for a week now.
Look just as pictured.
Theyre comfortable, light, sturdy, & Ive put the water resistance to the test numerous times!
I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!!
I generally wear a US size 7 woman's, and I got this  size with wool socks in mind.
With regular socks too.
No complaints at all.
On the other hand, it is also quite waterproof.
However they were the only ones available in my size.
They look like they would be like walking around in cinderblocks but they are like walking around on clouds.
I would buy them again tomorrow!
Comfortable  And waterproof
These boots are awesome.
They are GREAT boots and held up for miles and miles of hiking.
Weather proof, it has stood up well to the wet chilly Wisconsin weather.
I liked them.
However theyre tough, and pretty much very heavy!
Just returned from Aspen skiing in 19 F
I usually find my shoes to be to snug and wide fit to be to large.
Currently breaking them in doing a workout.
Comfort
Not to expensive.
Actually my second pair in 4 years.
I work in them and also plan to do outside activities in them once the weather permits hiking ? I have kinda wide feet so these also meet my expectations to be comfortable!
I bought these for hiking in the fall in Banff Canada.
We had temps ranging from the 60s to the teens.
I wore these boots every day, hiking up to 3 hours at a time, sometimes twice a day.
They were GREAT!
This was even after rain and walking across tiny streams.
I couldnt have asked more of these boots!
I LOVE my new boots!
, and thats with a pair of Carhartt wool socks on.
I wore them yesterday on the trail and was in 4 inches of water at times....
These hiking boots are very comfortable.
I would recommend!
The boots are good for regular walking.
THANK YOU COLUMBIA!!!!
Me, being a transgendered person
I was wearing pink shoelaces with one other pair of boots.
Now, these...taking a stand for myself.
Let's see what my mother says this time around!!
I suspect that I will look into getting a different pair of Columbia laces here soon enough.
?
Wife wanted to go hiking on trails, she chose these boots.
She talks about the boots...  So I guess these are pretty great, and you probably won't be disappointed.
They are completely waterproof, which is what i needed!
maybe a little snug if i wore thick socks.
A great find and price, IMHO.
Americans are larger than the rest of the world and skimping on materials means returned boots & shoes.
Estn perfectos la talla es la correcta, son cmodos!
Ms de lo que esperaba!
I work in landscaping and spend all day on my feet.
I've had them for about 2 months and they are still wearing well and have broken in nicely.
I plan to get a couple more pairs.
I ordered these boots for a hiking trip.
I had shopped and shopped in local stores and online and I found these.
On Amazon, some colors are more expensive than others so I got one of the less expensive colors but I'm hiking and get dirty so who cares right.
I wore them hiking in a multi-terrain area
I would order them again.
I'm typically between a 6.5 and 7 on shoe sizes depending on brand and material but this came in and fits perfect.
Most comfortable boot I ever purchased.
Wear all day!
Wore these right out of the box on a 6 mile hike.
NO ISSUES.
I dreaded the idea of breaking in a new boot.
I'm going to Iceland next year and these will be making the trip with me.
I'm SOOO glad I bought them.
I purchased a pair in 2 different sizes for my wife.
So far I'm happy with these Columbia hiking boots.
I also like them because they were under $100.
I read all the reviews and the sizing chart before ordering.
have run multiple marathons).
I put these on and hiked about 10-miles total at Old Rag Mountain in VA.
Let me tell you -- these are so much more supportive than regular tennis shoes.
10/10 - so glad I bargain hunted instead of buying full price boots somewhere local.
I also thought i was gonna be tripping over the metal parts that the laces tie through but I've been ok so far.
miles, my feet are sore.
Just 1/2 size down.
Comfortable from the moment I put them on.
I have been wearing them for ten days now as every day shoes because they are so comfortable.
.
more a megenta red
I have been searching for a decent pair of hiking/work boots, and came across these.
Ive had them for just over a month now, and I am on my feet a good 8 to 10 hours a day five days a week.
These are the most comfortable and light weight boots I have ever owned.
These are my new go to boots.
I absolutely love my hiking boots, they are super comfortable and true to size.
I do wish I would have gotten the brown ones since it gets dusty when hiking but just wipe them with a cloth and they look like new.
I bought these for an upcoming trip to Iceland.
We will be hiking and planning on having significant changes in weather, with a lot of rain, and a variety of conditions.
To hike the Inca Trail in the rainy season, we needed high traction, waterproof hiking boots.
These boots were comfortable right out of the box -- just put them on and go.
Needless to say, in the rainy season, the boots encountered a lot of wet.
After awhile (like 10
Hope they really are waterproof because they are for my trip to Alaska this summer.
These boots are very nice
I took them to the snow and went snowshoeing in them as well as used micro spikes at San Jacinto peak, and my feet were soaked at half point.
I think the snow melted through the tongue.
I love these hiking boots.
I am wondering if they are original, a little hard, not very comfortable
I bought these boots for my trip to Iceland.
Trs bien adaptes  la marche en hiver la semelle nest pas trop dure on peut faire de longues marches tout de suite sans avoir besoin de les forcer elles schent trs vite trs bon produit
These are excellent boots.
Took my dog for a 2 hr hike in the rain with tall wet grass and never had wet feet.
They were comfortable right off the hop.
Broke in easily.
I use mine as work boots instead of hiking.
Waterproof.
My feet were slightly damp after walking in slushy snow and mud.
.
I couldnt have been happier with the purchase!
This is my second pair.
The first lasted 4 years.
I work in corn fields pretty much everyday.
These help me so much in different terrains all over the state.
I didnt blister and I was wearing them for a good 6 or 7 hours.
Columbia are a great brand!
Llegaron antes de tiempo!Las botas estn muy bonitas y son sumamente cmodas!
Confortable fit and for walking and hiking.
I'm very glad I purchased them, as they are well made, soft, suede(nubuck) and r waterproof.
I cant wear anything but natural materials
man made shoes and boots make your feet sweat because they dont breathe, and they tend to take on odors to the point that u have to throw them out.
I put them through it too!
My feet were never sore, and they kept out the elements.
I wore them around the house a little and gardening once to break them in.
Idale pour la randonne pdestre en hiver.
Je les adore!!
Elles sont juste parfaite, confortable, juste assez chaude
I will update my review once I've actually used them!
I ordered my usual size, and they fit perfect!
My wife has used this shoe in two hikes!
Wore them 3 times now, went on a 3/4 mile walk.
First time destroyed my feet.
Third time really set in the blisters.
I bought these to go hiking in the northern part of my state in the winter.
They didnt require much breaking in which was nice, however because of the way that the high-top style is designed it did rub at the heel (not a big problem once I put on thicker socks,) but in terms of ankle support it pulled through.
I have enjoyed using them on numerous hikes and they have so far kept me safe and dry.
Fingers crossed this continues.I am in Southern California and consider these my 'winter' hiking boots.
Hope this helps!
Las recomiendo mucho, adems de ser de calidad son hermosas.
I live and work in southern Arizona and wanted a full leather boot because a grass seeds have a major tendency to get caught in all the seams of my Keen Targhee 2 boots.
Perfect fit.
Wish I had bought them sooner
These boots are light weight, sturdy with good ankle support and good teeth on the bottom for gripping.
They are run true to size, but roomy (I like to wear 2 pairs of socks, or when I need heavier socks they will fit),  And the price is right.
.
So far they are completely waterproof, which is one of the main reasons that I got them.
They are a little big without thick socks but still comfortable.
Hopefully they last me years!
Muy cmodas, las us en bosque en poca de lluvia y mis pies permanecieron secos.
Ran them through mud, dirt and water for 9
I ordered these in my normal size and a size larger.
Lightweight.
Some folks might want a fit thats a little looser to allow different type of socks but some might want a more snug fit.
Typically walk 10-15 a day.
These are my 2nd pair.
I hope they never stop making them
Wore them for the 1st time on a 5.5-mi hike.
I like the construction and the look tho.
They are higher around my skinny ankles than my last pair so Im getting used to that.
I wear an 8.5-9 depending on brand.
These had alot more toe room than expected for an 8.5 and I have medium width feet.
Theyre also pretty light in my opinion.
What's more, they required ZERO break in time.
You could buy these boots and hike all day in them the next day.
Fantastic shoes and worth every penny.
Definitely be buying another pair when the one ive got wears out.
I've had these boots for about seven months.
I've had the laces catch a bit over the last seven months, but a few days ago, one of the laces came unhooked from one boot and re-hooked onto the other boot hook.
It was just as if someone had tied my shoelaces together.
I work outdoors in all weather and often use a hose to clean.
They took a few days to break in and be comfortable, but now they fit well and don't hurt at all.
Kind of pricey, which is expected of Columbia products, but all around solid hiking boots.
Returned and reordered a half size up and they fit with a thick hiking sock.
They fit well, I just won't be able to wear thick socks when it gets colder.
I needed a pair of boots for a last minute hiking trip, and ordered these on a whim.
4 stars because I haven't actually been on my trip yet to really test them, but I have high hopes based on what I see so far!!
The first pair I ordered was defective, there was a huge lump in the inside by the ball of my foot.
I returned the item and was sent a replacement.
Their placement is perfect!
It helps that I also wear them with thick warm socks.
I use these shoes when walking my dog in the winter and to the dog park.
Nice soft tongue.
The shoe runs slightly bigger.
I cant speak for quality as I will be returning for a smaller size, but they ran big for me.
So just be mindful, if deciding between two sizes, go with the smaller.
Ordered 1/2 up per customer reviews and was a perfect fit!
I ordered 1/2 size up cause your feet swell when hiking and Im prone to ingrown toenails.
Going to be using them on trip to Ireland
Wow!
A MUST for anyone who likes to casually hike!
I ordered half a size up and wish I just stayed at my regular size 8.
I was looking for a decent pair of boots for my 14 year old daughter who has 11.5 feet.
I am returning these.
Through the entire trip of a few weeks, they were very comfortable over rocky, slippery and wet terrain, wore them for at least 8 hours each day.
I would recommend.
The sizing was different so I got them in a 7.
I hiked my Washington in these!
These were perfect straight out of the box 10/10!!
My first hike in my new boots was over 6 miles.
I only got blisters on one toe.
I bought 2 colors and they are both much darker than shown.
Not a deal breaker for me but just a caution.
Would buy again.
Bought .5 size up to allow space for thicker socks.
I purchased these for hiking.
First day I got them, I went hiking in a stream.
These were great with traction for the most part and are definitely water proof.
I bought these shoes to try for crime scenes since we go out in all kinds of weather.
We recently had a scene in pouring rain and wind.
They are comfortable, sturdy and can sustain you on any rocky, muddy, smooth and uneven terrain.
The style is cute and functional and the laces are pretty good, only having to retie 1-2 times on a 10 hour hike.
Me encantaron!
Las compr para hacer senderismo y son ultraligeras y comodsimas, adems de ser repelentes al agua.
Las ped en 4.5 mx y siento que me quedaron al menos 1/2 nmero ms grandes.
Solamente las ajusto bien y listo.
Ampliamente recomendables, a un excelente precio y calidad.
These hiking boots rule.
Very sturdy and a great product considering the price.
I feel content that they wont get destroyed on me anytime soon :)
I'm happy with the purchase, BUT I would have gotten another color if they were all the same price.
I got the least expensive black ones.
C'mon!
That's why I'm giving Columbia 3 stars.
My feet stayed dry)!
These boots arrived just on time before a camping trip to Yosemite, and the first time ever that I wore them, was to hike El Capitan!
I have raved about them ever since!
I LOVE THEM.
Muy cumplidos gracias
Id definitely recommend buying these.
Me quedaron Perfectos
I have REALLY narrow feet, high arches and overpronate.
I bought them for a class I'm taking that goes on field trips.
It was going to be 100
I'll wear ankle socks next time, though.
I did size up by 1/2 because I like to wear thick socks and still be able to move my toes around comfortably.
**my family hikes for fun, so don't know how these would be on long trips/"professional" hikes
I went to the local sporting goods store and tried on these shoes to ensure I had the right size.
They are warm and didnt need any real breaking in before taking them on a hiking trip.The tongue of the shoe does fall forward on one boot (right), but that may be because of the way I walk (?)
.
Im glad I bought these!
Love these sturdy boots, cute too.
I wear orthotics and a heel lift.
Other than that great waterproof hiking boot!
Love these boots to wear for work, hiking, trail walking or even shopping.
I wore them recently on a trip to central New York and with a pair of Carhart heavier socks, my feet got a little cold when outside for an hour or so, but not bad at all, and to be honest I didnt buy them as a winter boot anyhow.
Comfortable, supportive.
These boots have sturdy soles making rocky trails bearable, perfect ankle support, and keep your feet dry in rainy conditions.
Columbia is a great brand for quality at a reasonable price.
They seem to be well made!
I like that they are waterproof!
I am looking forward to using them often!
Habituellement je porte du 6.5 dans mes chaussure et je voulais un peu plus grand pour mettre un gros bas... les bottes sont ultras confortable et me laisse de l'espace comme prvu pour mon bas!
Je suis compltement en amour avec le produit.
Wow!
I found these to be comfy hiking boots.
If you've been looking at these for a while.
.
BUY THEM!!
Love these boots
Amazing shoes.
I am working 10 hours a day and all the time on my feet walking.
I make 10 miles walking every day.
My heels wont hurt either.
All in all these shoes are amazing.
If I jave to buy again I will purchase the same.
Amazing
I wear them often.
I did upgrade the laces though!
There are now 4 pairs of these boots in my immediate family.
One sister wore hers to hike the Grand Canyon earlier this year.
I ordered it just before I went on a trip where I hiked quite a bit.
I was hesitate about sizing because of some of the reviews I read on here so I ended up just getting my normal size and it fit perfectly!
Was exactly what I wanted!
They are all that I have come to expect from the Columbia brand.
They never hurt my feet.
I am a size 6 but ordered a black size 6.5.
This was the perfect shoe for long hikes.
Very comfortable!!!!!
Second pair of these for my daughter who outgrew the last pair.
I thought I would order these and give them a try.
The first thing I want to know is are these really leather?
Anyone?
It may be the ultimate deciding point on whether I keep them and give them a try or not.I ordered a half size up to accommodate a heavier sock and possibly a foot bed liner as I do better with than without those.
Advice on this end is also welcome.
Remember, I'm a beginner.
Consider sizing up half a size for room for thicker socks.
I bought these boots for a cross country trip.
Stiff upper portion took awhile to break in.
I think they are waterproof, but noticed some mid-toe leaking after walking in heavy snow.
Recieved these boots yesterday wore them around the house for a bit.
I have high arches.
Put insoles in.
Took them on a two hour hike today.
I didnt realize they were womens boots when I bought them.
I Iike these boots VERY much.
These boots are so comfortable and light weight.
Love theses boots, fit perfect and very comfortable.
I always get a 1/2 size larger in boots and they fit great, I where 7 1/2 and ordered an 8, also have room to move your toes.I have planter fasciitis and my feet always hurt, I have been buying keen targhee and at first they where great but for some reason my feet have changed and they now hurt my feet.
I decided to try the Columbia Newton and love them so far.Also you can remove the inserts and put your own in.
Theyre my first pair of hiking boots and are great if you're looking for a cheap pair of boots without sacrificing quality.
Bought them for a week in Iceland in winter and ended up wearing snow boots the majority of the time because even with wool socks these didnt keep hm feet warm.
True to size.
Lots of room.
Wore these hiking in Colorado and I cant say enough good about them.
Buy them!
These are photos of left boot after 3.5 hrs having them on.
I rang several numbers to ask what to do but everyone I spoke to directed me to another one.
I really like these boots.
I normally wear a 5.5 in a pump or a 6 in flats or sneakers.
Trs bonnes bottes!
The width is correct, but I find the size 6 seems smaller than usual, squeezing my toes.
These hiking boots were exactly what I was looking for.
I definitely recommend.
So far, they have been waterproof.
Some call these middle of the line hiking boots.
For me, they were a bit expensive, but worth every penny I spent on them.
This is the second pair Ive ordered in the past year (one in blue and one in brown).
Looks more expensive than the asking price.
I hiked at Red Rock Canyon's Calico Basin Trail at Las Vegas, and these shoes gave me the confidence to finish the trail despite the steeper parts.
I would like to give them 5 stars.
Lacing could be better firm boots.
In process of breaking them in they are comfortable.
I like the way they look.
I need that when hiking.
This is my second pair of Columbia boots.
This was my first hiking shoe.
I used these to camp out for several days in backcountry Utah and also wore them every day while working for nature conservation where we spend time time in the freezing mountains, the dessert, and also in and out of streams in all kinds of weather conditions.
These have been my saving grace.
In this past few days of snow sleet and ice, I have had the benefit of my new hiking boots!
Held up to the inclement weather without any damage to the boots!
These were purchased for my daughter, we do a lot of day hikes around the area we live.
I plan to get more in different colors
I did need to add a 3/4-insert with a bit of extra heel padding, but spent five days walking and sight-seeing in NY City right after I bought these and my feet did great!
I walk/ hike daily 3-8 miles.
The soles lasted only six months but that's probably due to the mileage.
I now use the greys for brief errands.
True to size with room for a thicker sock.
I originally ordered a half size larger and had to send that back.
Typical hiking boots don't give me the room for thicker sock and foot flex.
Walked all day and feet were ok
I really wanted to like these shoes!
However, unless you are walking on even ground or pavement, you will get blisters!
I wear these now as rain boots.
I purchased these boots for my mother to do work in the yard.
The boots were perffect for what I needed.
I did purchase mink oil with them and applied that before ussing.
I use these boots all the time.
I didnt even have to break them in!
True to size.
I wear a 9.5 running shoe, and an 8.5 in any other shoe.
Defective boot, how did this pass inspection.
One insole shorter than the length of the boot
I spent a couple of days breaking them in.
I spent a couple of days hiking and Yosemite National Park and they did a great job.I order my size.
I did three back to back days of hiking through UT and AZ, with wool socks, and there was still plenty of room in the shoe
I recommend these shoes, definitely waterproof and sturdy for a great price.
I was afraid to order hiking boots online.
My walking shoes had been getting soaked while walking my dog each morning.
Ugh!
I had bones removed from my right foot so I'm always looking for the most comfortable shoe
especially for hiking!
10/10!!!
These shoes were a lifesaver for hiking!
All of my other friends had wet feet by the end of the hike and these boots kept my feet dry and blister free.
Great shoes!
These boots are very comfortable, waterproof and easy to match!Ive been to a few different hikes and it has a great ankle support.
I definitely recommend it.
Next time i will get a half size smaller.
I have skinny feet size 7
These boots are awesome.
Look smaller in size, more like size 7.5.
I ordered these for my wife , she always uses columbia boots for work .
I tried 7.5 and it was a bit snug so went with the 8.
I bought one size up, based on reviews and suggestions and definitely don't regret it!
Feet stay warm but feet don't get hot.
Like the sturdy shoelaces.
They were okay for the first few hikes when I was breaking them in.
Decided to go on a 5 mile hike and ended up getting them wet while crossing a river.
I bought them for a recent trip to Iceland.
They do run big.
I ordered 71/2 to make sure I had room for thick socks and they are still a tad large.
I feel like I could walk all day in them, and I have!
Broke these in while in Colorado.
They made it to the summit with ease.
I didnt get a single blister despite this being the first time I wore them.
Plus they are waterproof.
Ces bottes sont parfaites...wowww
These boots did the job and required no break in period.
First hike in them was a 7 mile loop with a 90% incline (lots of scrambling) in 110 degrees weather.
There are the ones for you.
10/10 would recommend.
Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
I tried so many different shoes, but this one is true to size and fits perfectly.
Came packaged very well too.
From the moment I slipped my feet into them for the first time.
Im ready to buy another pair.
Got these for my wife for our longer hikes.
I feel the soles on these hiking boots should have lasted longer.
I love these boots- they fit great, feel great, and are comfortable on long hikes, or even just wearing around town.
Hiking in the snow, or even in just some puddles will get the inside of the shoe wet.
Bought a pair of brown and black ones!!
I just got back from a field trip in my geology class.
Looking forward to my next hike.
Would buy again!
I considered my purchase money well spent!
There was NO WAY I could make it on a trail in these.
They're very durable and they hold my ankle stable when climbing and walking.
Nice looking boot & seems well made.
The fit is narrow on my medium width foot.
Ill keep them & keep trying to break in gradually since I threw out the packing materials after first tried on.
Boots fit perfect
These hiking boots are comfortable but could use a bit more padding.
I like the look also.
Mostly, I use them when walking my dogs.
Hug my feet in a warm, supportive way, not tight.
I bought them to work (field-based) desert.
The shoe laces are way to long!
I have to double tie them.
I feel like a little kid.
I'm 60 years old.
LOL  I wish they were the right size for the boots I bought.
But other then that.
Thank you!Wendy
La suela se desliza fcilmente en superficie hmeda
I have been walking on rocks, painful and aggravating!!
I ended up ordering true to size and they fit great!
The inserts come out in case you have custom shoe inserts.
The shoes fit great.
I am hard on them as I hike regularly.
I need a 8.5 wide.We have even gone as far as contacting the seller here on Amazon.
.
or not available.
.
Just cant seem to order from there.
.
So, My next step is to contact the company directly.
.
I normally wear a size 8... Heck I would even buy a size 6 in Men's.
.
However, when I tried on this brand in the size 8.
.
.
.
it was a Perfect fit.
easily get hurt
Buy your actual size.
Dont size up.
But not waterproof.
These ones are metal hooks and super sturdy (they've gotten caught on my bike pedal a couple of times and have held up fine).
Definitely recommend
I really like these boots!
I bought these boots and have been wearing them for about a week now.
.
It just seems like dust sticks to them in abundance.
Nice ankle support.
I bought them for a weekend hike.
No blisters.
I'm always a size 9.
Got a size 9 and it fit perfectly.
Get shoes for a great price.Update-over 2 months later and multiple hiking weekends still the perfect boot.
Comfy.
These boots are awesome.
This is my second pair.
These boots are light weight.
They are as comfortable as sneakers on a walk.
And best is I can wear them indoors (shopping) without getting sweaty feet!
the boots arrived on time n new.
Tried it out today.
I wore it for almost 3 hours of shoveling snow in the 15F.
my feet were warm throughout the three hours of being in the snow.
in the past, when I shovel snow.
I wore three pairs of socks with my other boot.
Will update once I put it to use in water.
She got so many compliments on them.
exactly as advertised.
Super comfy.
The first time I used them was to hike The Narrows trail in Zion Utah.
I bought these boots to go hiking in Ireland.
Every time I took a step, that seam just dug into the top of my foot where it bends at base of toes.
Wore these for a week of travel throughout Scotland/Ireland as well as some local hiking trips.
Liked
Very comfortable and durable.
It pinches and rubs the top of my big toe when walking, even just around the apartment, until the point my toe was rubbed red.
Suelo hacer hiking constantemente y estas botas son las mejores!
I used them in the Denver snow and on uphill.
I usually take a size 7.5 and always go up half a size when buying boots to be able to wear a thicker sock.
These size 8's fit perfectly.
I put these on as soon as they arrived.
Glad I bought them.
Looks just like the photo.They fit great, and to my surprise they are not heavy at all.Im a senior lady and like taking walks with my dogs and you cant beat it.They are water proof so if i get caught in the rain im covered for that too.
I live in Colorado and there is plenty of places to explorer.
These boots are so light weight.
Bought these boots for my Utah trip.
Did a bunch of hikes with them and they held great!
Perfect hiking boots I would definetly recommend.
I wear these boots every time I go hiking.
My feet stay bone dry when crossing water.
I did apply some more waterproofing spray.
I usually do even though the boots are waterproof.
Im a size 7 and thats what I ordered.
Perfect fit
They are ok for simple, short hikes
My feet are very sore and blistered.
I am a bit concerned about the shoelace loops.
They are metal and attached to the outside of the boot.
I wish they were regular eyelets.
I was unsure about buying these shoes.
I wear them everyday.
Ordered them because we were hiking up Old Rag.
Used and insole -perfect.
Would recommend to someone else.
Honestly, I couldn't wish for anything more :)
I love love love these hiking boots!!!
Decent boots.
I purchased these for hiking the Colorado trails and soon into my hike, I noticed pains exactly where other reviewers have mentioned.
The crease on top of the toe is very much a constant nuisance.I bought a huge box of bandaids just to continue on the trails for the next 3 days.
Silly, I know but I was determined to finish my hiking trip.
They were the only pair of hiking boots I had.
These boots were great for hiking around Iceland.
I ordered a few pairs in different colors.
I perfect fit!
I bought them right before leaving to hike in Canada so I was hoping they would be comfy.
I got lots of compliments!
Just throw on a pair of you fave hiking socks and hit the trails in these shoes!
I had seen these at a local store and tried them on in a size 5.5, my size.
I found them on Amazon for almost 1/2 the price so I bought them.
I have been wearing them around the house all day for a few days now, just to soften them up and break them in a bit.
Not worth the price.
Better to spend $40 more and get a Merrel or Keen if you can.....
These look and feel like a $50 boot at most.
El zapato muy bueno y cmodo!!
Me aceptaron la cancelacin y despus lleg y cobraron igual!!
Amazon est poco formal ahora!!!
I thought that they were larger because of the style since they are different than other sneakers I've had.
They are lightweight yet sturdy.
Must confortable hiking boots youll find in the market.
Bought it a few days before a Colorado hiking trip.
10/10!!!
I actually purchased these to offset my good foot with my bad foot (fractured/wearing a boot).
Initial wearing I was a bit concerned, crease area across top of foot was a bit much, lasted all of 15 minutes.
They have done off trail summer hiking, snowshoeing and hiking thru 14 of snow.
No rubbing or chafing.
I ordered these shoes to wear during an upcoming hiking visit to the northwest.
WRONG!
Talk about comfortable!
Seriously, I never had new shoes fit so well and feel so good.
Just what I was looking for in a hiking boot.
I did wear two afternoons around the house without any issues.
Pinched in the toe box, folded right down in the middle of my big toe!
For a 9, these felt tight.
I love love love these boots.
Second pair I have owned.
Hold up to a lot of hiking and are waterproof to!
My wife liked the color
These are great and cute.
Ive got narrow flat feet so I love them.
I would recommend them and I would buy them again.
I go to these to wear for work as I'm a fisheries technician in environmental consulting.
They are a little stiff to begin with but have excellent ankle support.
Got these boots for a camping/backpacking trip.
They are comfortable too, and required almost no breaking in.
Plus they are cute for hiking boots.
Liked everything about them...
Im originally a size 7 in sneakers.
Boots came today.
Not enough padding in the sole.
I am an 8.5 and I bought a 9.
A little big but so far they have kept my feet warm and dry.
I am a size 7 and bought a 7.5m, they were a bit roomy even with hiking socks on.
If I were to buy again I would go with a size 7.
Otherwise, Id say theyre true to size and they would have been very comfortable.
Decided that buying online wasnt a safe bet and ended up going to a Columbia store and getting a pair of Wayfinders that were regular width and a 1/2 size up from what I normally buy.
Overall....Columbia shoe sizes dont seem to be consistent, so its probably better to go to a store and try them on in person before you buy online.
I absolutely loved these boots at first.
During my day at work I am mostly in an office setting but I used them to lead cave tours and short hikes as well.
They gave me no issues until a couple weeks ago.
Otherwise seems to be a good shoe although I would like more support and/or padding in the insole.
Perfect footwear for the active woman.
I recommend this boot for any outdoor activity.
They cleaned very easily and still look like new!
Half the price of my Keens and 100x better, more comfortable and more stylish!
A lot more lightweight than you would imagine.
Love my boots will be ordering more for me and some for the kids.
My feet did not hurt from all the hiking.
I also used them to ride horses.
Round two of this style (RIP 1st pair).
In New England, it is a necessity to have boots you can count on.
Once you have had your adjustment period, it's go time!
Easy to put on, take off and get the job done.
My boyfriend is a carpenter and I need proper shoes to be in his shop.
I spent the entire day with it and normally my toes would hurt but it didnt
I started wearing these boots as soon as they arrived in the mail because I thought I would have to break them in before an upcoming hiking trip.
Corren un poquito grande so elige exactamente tu size
Love the look of these hiking boots!!
Love these boots!!
Didnt need to break them in at all.
Nice aesthetics, made well and comfortable.
After wearing them all winter I can say that they are truly waterproof.
Now I need to get a pair for my daughter so we can hike together!
Great hiking boots.
And they really are waterproof.
Las ocup en un viaje a la Huasteca Potosina y me sorprendi lo cmodas que son, adems de tener una suela antiderrapante y ser impermeables.Quiz vengan un poco amplias, ya que compr las de talla 22.0 siendo que yo calzo del 22.5 y me quedaron bien.
Aunque cabe resaltar que tengo el pie delgado.
These boots are incredible!
The lacing at the top of the boot really ensures that my ankles are supported, which is important for me as I have a history of injuries with them and bought boots that came higher to prevent new sprains.
They're well made, and I'm sure they'll last me ages.
This boot covers my requirements and accommodates bunions on both feet.
Your feet stay dry and feel very supported.
This shoe is an excellent, affordable buy!
I have owned these boots for a while- have used them to hike in different types of weathers and conditions.
I would buy them again.
Are these a good looking shoe?
Guter bequemer wanderschuh.Preis Leistung super
I was skeptical because of the price but they were so comfortable!
Hiked almost a mile in the snow and my feet were completely warm and dry
I went to Zion national park and went through puddles of water and they are definitely waterproof only up to the top of the shoe obviously.
love the lace too.
Perfect fit.
Light weight
These were wonderful, comfortable, good support and got me through miles of hiking with zero issues and no blisters or any discomfort.
Quedan estrechas an cogiendo un nmero ms
Not my favorite item from Columbia.
We'll see if they are waterproof.
On the first hike I got abrasions on the top of my toes.
The Columbia tread is the reason for the purchase and brand loyalty.
Awesome!
Comfortable on the first day.
I bought it for my wife.
Used them for a few hikes.
I even wore them just walking around town because theyre so freaking comfortable.
So glad I bought these!
I really like my boots!
I think they look a lot better than most hiking boots too.
Most are really ugly, but I like these.
The boots are in great condition and work well for my hikes on slippery slopes.
I returned them!
These boots are COMFY.
They supported my ankles and held up to quite the beating on a snowy mountain top and 13,000 feet of elevation.
I usually wear a 10.5.
Overall they do the job, you get what you pay for!
Oh how I wanted to love these boots.
Very sadly I will be returning these.
These shoes hold up to a lot of ware.
If you are using these to hike occasionally they will last you a long time (a few years).
Its been a few months now and I love them, even in the snow.
Did 7000ft elevation hike with these shoes.Amazing !
La grandeur 9.5 est disponible mais le prix a augment beaucoup.Je veux que quelqu'un me tlphone
Not so.
First day I wore them feet were hurting by the end of the day.
So, second day I added in my insoles.
I average 11,000 to 17,000 steps a day.
I haven't worn Columbia boots in quite awhile but loved the look of these.
But again, only one season each.
Size as mentioned.
They are super easy to put on and lace.
I like these very comfy.
Recommend
Super light weight.
Comfortable, but you may need insoles or arch supports.
I really wanted to like these boots.
*sigh*
Used for the first time hiked 8 miles in them.
I have a narrow foot which was fixed by tightening.
No break in time needed.
The boots are a little bit large.
Also, I will like the extra room for thick socks in cold wear.
I think an inset would have made them even better!
Love that it comes in a wide foot option to order.
Fits great and made well.
Ordered two pairs
one for my daughter and myself.
I wear these boots every day at work but I expected them to last more than a couple weeks being Columbia.
Not a heavy boot.
Wore them all day at work.
No fatigue.
I hiked the smokies with these boots, 13 mile round trip along with a couple day hikes.
I wore these hiking today for the first time.
I thought I would have to break them in but they were so comfortable!
Also a perfect fit!
This is the 3rd pair of hiking boots that I bought this season - after returning the first 2 pair.
Go with the brand that does it well - Columbia.
De buena calidad
Fit as expected.
.
Like a cheaper version of the timberland white ledge mid waterproof hiking boot.
Not really much support in the sole, but could put an insert in.
I went with the Timberlands instead.
Comfortable
Fits great!
I wore these boots on my motorcycle and got caught in rain.
The shoe top was soaked and so were my socks.
These boots passed expectations.
I ordered true to size and they fit perfect.
However, the boots came with two different sized shoe laces!
a 5 inch difference!
Bought these for a trip to Iceland, but I've been breaking them in on hiking trips around home first.
Fit great, don't rub at all and walked through a swamp without getting wet inside.
We had tried expensive REI shoes and those gave her blisters.
I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 and I decided to get the 9.
I wore a thick pair of socks and still had room.
I was worried reading the other reviews about the "toe crease" that other had experienced.
t read about it in the reviews.
I say, if you are on the fence, give them a try!
Wore them for a 18 mile hike held up through rain, puddles, and dirt.
I got these boots for a week long camping trip through the Pacific Northwest.
These boots are great!
It took about a 7 mile walk to get them broken in well enough to use seriously.
I read the reviews that mentioned that, but decided to try anyway.
I am going to try thicker socks next time to see if that helps.
They are slightly on the heavy side, but decent grip and durable.
I love love love love love these shoes.
I love them !!!!
Bye bye Timberlands!!
Im very picky about my shoes!
But definitely still comfortable
belle emais pas trs confortable
I took them caving, hiking, landscaping, trail maintenance-ing with the US Forestry Service, camping, etc etc, and I was walking on well-gripping clouds the whole time.
they were comfortable from the start.
I broke them in on Stevens Trail (expert level hike in California) and my feet felt like they were on clouds.
Use for hiking.
I actually bought these for my future wife.
First day in hardcore use we trekked up to the Torres Del Paine base 5 hours of pure uphill and 3 hours coming down and a week filled will similar activities.
My feet were the only things that were not sore by the end of that adventure!
These boots are awesome!
I wore them for the first time on a hiking trip!
I got a 7.5 which is my usual size and they fit perfectly!
I had no blisters and was very pleased and impressed with the quality of this product!
I would recommend these boots to everyone looking for a pair of summer hiking boots!
I love the coloring too.
Bought these for a trip up the north shore here in Minnesota and they were PERFECT.
Super comfortable and warm.
Daughter wears women's 8.5 in Nike and Vans(with laces) or 8 in slip on Vans, I ordered these in a 8.5 and they fit perfectly.
I wore them around, running errands to break them in.
Great hiking boots ordered them and already hiked for a week.
Comfortable fits great around the ankle too
Really nice quality they fit great very comfortable exactly what I wanted
Worse these all over the pacific north west in October.
Theyve been to the mountains, beach, and national parks.
Las seguir usando en todas mis expediciones para hacer senderismo!
They take quite a bit of breaking in but so far they have been awesome for shorter hikes.
Fit me a little big but they were really good quality!
Listen to the reviews and wait till Colombia fixes this issue on a 2.0 pair!
Returned these and kept the keens.
Hiked 2 miles the day I got them.
They have good support and i could feel the difference from when i usually use my regular sneakers.
Had them for about 2 weeks now and taken them on many different trails!
Bought it for a road trip to Grand Canyon.
I used for drive motorcycle.
Very cover.
They support with light rain, but heavy rain doesnt.
----Casi Perfectas.
Totalmente perfecta para trabajos de largos turnos
Love how tough the putter shoe fabric is.
Also, they're cute as hell.I'm a size 7 and had plenty of room for thicker socks if needed.
So you have extra toe space in regular socks.
Great shoes!
I have these in tan too.
Most comfortable boots in this genre I have ever owned.
Not waterproof.
We had freezing rain today, I live in Ohio.
Crossed several rocky streams with these boots and they are indeed waterproof.
These boots were very comfortable and supportive.
They were very cute on and not too bulky.
Out the box, 7 miles uphill in Yosemite NP.
I probably should have stayed with my normal size though.
Great fit.
This is the 4th pair of Columbia's that I've gotten.
Pour moi.
Je les aime bien.
Wear thick socks with these, order normal size.
I have gone through 5 pairs until I found these.
They can keep your feet really warm in a cold area with a good pair of socks.
Not only are they cute, but they are very comfortable.
Love these they are exactly what I was looking for.
Very comfortable and warm and the fit is perfect
No blisters, comfortable, and wore them for the first time on a 4 mile hike that included a lot of scrambling in trekking in knee deep water.
They are my first pair of hiking boots.
One suggestion was to get thicker socks which is what I will try next.
I was looking for a winter-type boot for walking on our roads when they are slushy and snowy, as I walk quite a lot.
I ordered these Columbia boots and received them yesterday.
Right out of the box, they were already a comfy fit!
Awesome hiking boots.
Excited to find a hiking boot in a size 12 for women.
I just put an insert in and that seems to work.
These US Women's size 8.5 fit very small.
This is my size in most other shoes.
Product not as advertised.
Light weight .
.
Get them!!
True to size.
Slightly wider foot size cf. to other Crestwood Columbia boots.
Used an arch insert for more support.
"im walking on sunshine" comes in mind when i need to describe this.
thinking of getting it in another color too
This pair lasted 2 weeks before they started falling apart.
Great boots to keep me safe and dry when I am adventuring outdoors!
They looked narrow and normally I need wide shoes but they fit great.
Particularly on wet days and against cactus.
These shoes are great for hiking and outdoor use plus there cuter than most hiking shoes.
They even did well on some snow up in the mountains!
Son las Botas que esperaba, me encantaron...
I did Machu Picchu and the hills in Cusco and the islands of lake Titikaka.
Dont forget wool socks when going hiking.
These are my favorite hiking boots I've ever owned.
I wear an 11 in dress shoes and a 12 in all sporting shoes.
Nothing from Lands end, LLBean, Keen, anyone...
These boots are exactly what I was looking for.
Theyre cute.
They run large.
I got an 8 (my usual size in boots) and had to exchange them for a 7.5.
Amazing.
I like the Columbia brand hiking shoe.
I used them for 4 weeks while hiking through Norway, and they are still in tip top condition (minus a lot of mud).
Got as expected, exactly what I needed
These boots are 1/2 to 1 whole size smaller, due to the narrower cut.
I am a size 10B.
A little more room in the toe area.
Im assuming for thicker socks.
Added an insert for more cushion
I use mine all the time.
?
Perfect for hiking.
.
I wear a 9
however, I had to purchase a 10.
Although my feet are narrow because I am barefoot most of the time but my toes expand outwards.
Kept my feet warm and dry the whole time!
They have been great here in the Pacific Northwest, rain, puddles, sprayed with a hose, waterproof 100%.
I received my shoes today, but one of the laces has broken as in that photo i sent to you, so I would like to have a new lace for my shoes, thank you!
Ill be wearing thicker socks so that will help.
I fit between 7.5 and 8 and wish I got the 7.5 but will keep the size 8.
Fit great!
Fantsticas!
I am glad I chose these shoes.
I wore them the first time for a 6-mile bumpy hike.
Id recommend wearing them in normal life before actually hiking in them to break them in a bit.
Took them on a 3 day hiking trip, and even though they were brand new they were still comfortable.
Love the color and they fit just GREAT!
Even have some room for wool socks.
Most comfortable hiking shoes I've had.
I'm size 10.5 - 11 and ordered size 11 since I had no other option and they fit great.
I bought these for hiking in Scotland.
We hiked in the rain and had to cross streams.
My feet were still dry at the end of my hike.
Amazing and fit great.
Ordered my usual 7.5 and they fit great.
Most importantly these are super cute,
Lightweight, great quality, stylish look.
I wore these during a hiking excursion in Belize in October.
We were there during the rainy season so it was really important I had something that were comfortable, had good traction and would keep my feet relatively dry.
These boots had great traction!
I'm still glad I got them!
These are so comfortable!!
So glad I purchased these.
Im a perfect 10.5 women's shoe size and its hard to find them.
They felt really tight when I first got them and I got a half size bigger.
my feet arent exactly narrow but after using these boots to go hiking a few times they loosened up.
Im a size 7 and I ordered a 7.
I just revisited the site and I got the black pair.
The word "leather" disappears for this boot.
I believe I can get a pair of real leather boots for the same price.
Devolv el producto.
I LOVE these boots!
First trip out in them, it rained the whole time.
My feet stayed completely dry!
A bit heavy and stuffy for the feet.
I like everything about them.
Everyday wear if appropriate for how I'm dressed
I can definitely say those shoes can be worn in snow winter (-7C) as well as hiking on dry hills.
It was frost but I didnt feel a thing!
Of course you should wear some thermal underwear and thick socks.
They are waterproof but I still put some protective spray on.
Aesthetically these boots are nice.
But like so many others said the top of the boot bends and rubbed the top of my foot with each step.
I returned these.
I ordered a size 9 which is my normal size shoe.
I will be buying them again.
Just what I was looking for to keep feet comfortable, warm, and dry!
Except it came with the magnet sensor still on it....
Parfait pour la randonne.
Bottes trs lgres
Great investment!
I was a bit hesitant about these shoes,but the color is perfect.Not too bright, but it has a touch of that pink.
Son unas botas demasiado cmodas y muy resistentes.
I especially like that they are black and brown so they pretty much match everything.
I would absolutely purchase this pair of shoes again!!!
Disclaimer - Only hiked in them once so far and they did fine.
Que decan que eran muy cmodos adentro de la bota y por eso la escog y son muy duros
My favorite pair of boots!
Wear them every day for work.
These boots were perfection and completely water proof.
These boots are EXCELLENT.
There are waterproof,  breathable and have a very high traction grip, exactly how they say.
Perfect for hiking.
I would buy them again.
I bought these before a recent camping trip that was expected to be rainy and they were exactly what I needed!
They fit very nice with thicker hiking socks on.
I knew they fit me.
Sure enough, Amazon offered a significant discount.
I loved it.
Elle sont parfaites, super confortable et impermable.
Je les adorent.
Acheter pour une deuxime fois ??
Needless to say I wouldnt buy them again because now I HAVE to wear a bandaid in order to wear them but other than that they are a decent boot.
I would suggest wearing these around for a little bit before you go hiking (if you get the leather ones.)
Lightweight yet super sturdy and supportive.
These boots are AMAZING!
I bought a pair for my trip to Iceland.
They are very inflexible
They are a bit longer in length than the Keen I have tried.
Wearing them right now and I am so inlove!
I'll recomend to my friends for sure
Pros:Boot fit perfectly.
They are waterproof.
I used them to hike around right after it snowed and ended up accidentally stepping in a deep puddle of ice water and they sure are waterproof.
Not a drop went inside.
Waterproof.
Good ankle support.
I bought them for a caving tour at Mammoth Cave national park in Kentucky.
But your feet do get hot after wearing them indoor for a couple hours.
Tested them out in wet terrain and they are waterproof, as advertised.
And waterproof!!
I really like these.
They were a little snug when I first tried them on but after wearing them around town for 2 days they fit perfectly.
These run a little big, but that is good for thick hiking socks.
I had to return these.
Not sure why they get such good reviews but returning them was the easiest experience ever.
THIS IS THE BEST WOMENS HIKING BOOT OUT THERE FOR THE MONEY.
I needed a new pair of boots for walking in the park with the dog.
.
Go Columbia Sportswear!!
.
these could be good mud trail hiking boots if I still did that.
.
but I don't.
.
Sucks.
Bought these for my teenaged daughter for backpacking trips.
Great purchase!
Buy them for my mom as a gift and she love them, they are pretty soft and comfortable, also keep your feet warm and dont let any water go inside
however, I only wore the shoes 1 full shift and 3 hours into my shift, the buckle for the laces popped off.
I mean literally popped off.
I have purchased Columbia boots before, and they lasted a full year.
I normally wear a 6 but I ordered a half size bigger for thicker socks, should have ordered a 6.
I ordered these boots for my first hiking trip to Colorado.
They are very comfortable.
I bought these in size 7.5 which is the normal size I buy in boots and running shoes and they fit perfectly!
Purchased for my daughter.
Great price
They are exactly what I wanted.
I have arch supports and was looking for something that would accommodate them.
Cant wait to hike in them!
They run a little small, but they are VERY comfy!
It took a couple days to break them in but theyre really comfortable now.
I have really narrow feet and my feet dont feel like theyre swimming around.
.
.
just bought a new pair.
Went a size up.
.
.
Never used to be
Beautiful boots, comfortable right out of the box!
Order your usual shoe size
Definitely a great buy.
Dont hesitate!
Get these
Great ankle support and fit overall
LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Waterproof indeed!
Its very comfy although my partners one rubs on the ankle
This is my 3rd pair of hiking boots from Columbia.
Thank you Columbia for making a boot that fits my feet.
Perfect for dirt bike tracks.
I got these for a trip to Scotland.
Not once did I slip on wet leaves or wet cobblestone.
I wear a 7.5 in regular shoes and bought an 8.5.
Will be returning them.
I have bought them twice.
This is my second pair of these boots.
I use them as every day work boots outdoors.
Great quailty and comfortable.
I've had for several months and they are holding up great
.
Exactly what I was looking for.
I really like these boots.
The toe crease bothered me on my first hike, but they are nicely broken in now.
Still waterproof.
I'm loving these boots.
I had been searching for a good hiking boot that I can wear on my hikes as well during yard work.
These are it.
Size of the shoes goes just right.
Used on 7 5-10 mile hikes so far.
I purchased these for my mother as she was looking for a work shoe.
Ive used these 3-4 times now during hikes with different terrain
I have been wearing these boots for about 2 weeks now and they seem to be good so far.
A couple more weeks of wear and they should be broke in enough for trail hiking.
Took these boots on a 35 mile hike on the MD portion of the AT.
My blisters only grew smaller as the trip went on.
I had to order a 1/2 size smaller than what I normally wear in a running shoe.
Bought these for an upcoming trip to the Swiss Alps.
Ive been wearing them around to make sure they are broken in before my trip.
I used these to hike up Mt. Batur in Bali.
I like the style of the boot.
I am hoping I can exchange these boots for a better pair.
I suggest buying a pair of insoles if you are going to be working in these boots all day.
These boots fit and feel great.
I tried these boots on at a store and passed on them.
I decided that I needed these and so I went on Amazon, where I was happy to find they were cheaper than at the store.
Everything about these are comfortable!
Able to go hiking on and off trails comfortably!
Wore them 1-2 days to break them in before we left but didnt really need to.
I got a size 9...~ 1/2 size bigger.
Perfect!
These are my second pair of hiking boots.
Awesome pair of boots!!!
No issues with the waterproof-ness!
When breaking them in, they made my toes hurt a little bit but I'm unsure of whether this was because of my foot or if this is consistent with the boot.
I have been on a countless amount of hikes wearing my running shoes.
It feels so amazing to have actual hiking boots.
I plan to go hiking within the next week and try them out.
Love the design, a bit on the heavier side but still easy to walk on.
I wore these boots for the 1ST TIME, hiking through the Rocky Mountains and exploring Denver, Colorado.
I bought this for my first all day height.
I bought the size I usually order and it fit perfectly.
Would be again and again.
I have had other hiking shoes before but this one is very comfy and lightweight.
But the suggested size for me was 6.5 but I went ahead with my usual 7.
They are roomy and Ill defin wear thicker socks with these.
Very pleased.
After reading the reviews I decided to get a half size larger and am glad that I did.
I bought these for my wife, and we used them on a hike today.
My wife is excited to go on our hikes!
I wore these during a trip to the mountains of Peru and used them literally everyday.
Barely needed to even break them in.
Used them for hiking around a swampy area, dry dusty area, and rocky area, these boots have conquered every terrain!
I really like these boots.
And because I plan on walking and hiking around in these boots for long periods of time , I got then a half size larger to allow for the usual foot swell and thicker socks.
Great price and fit.
I feel safe walking on snow and water.
Durable.
Great fit.
Comfortable.
Great quality.
No blisters after a long day of hiking.
Bought this for a hiking trip in Banff.
I usually wear a size 8 and ordered an 8 and fits perfectly.
These boots fit perfectly.
I wear a size 8 Wide in sneakers, so I was taking my chance on these 8M.
I sprayed them with boot protection, as I will be using these in the woods.
Very pleased with these.
First pair still in pretty good shape after four years of hard wear but thought a new pair was in order.
I even put on with thick wool socks and still had space to move my toes.
I was told they were true to size, but I would go a half size up if ordering again.
This is my second pair of this type of Columbia boot.
Exchanged for a different one but still Columbia.
It was under kids boots when i ordered it when I received it its women size 6
Randonne en raquette
I bought these boots for an upcoming trip, they felt great when I tried them on & walked around for a bit, anxious to try them out on my trip!
This is the third pair of these boots I have ordered.
I want to have them for a LONG time to come.
I tried these boots on and they fit beautifully.
I like the way that the boots fit and look.
These shoes have a lot of room in them!
I bought the size 6 and wish I went with the 5.5.
Lightweight, waterproof, and super comfortable.
Great value for the price and feel they will last a long time.
Its Columbia what else would you expect.
Great Value.
Then once I received my shoes they were uncomfortably narrow.
I even order up half a size.
I ware 9 1/2s so I ordered 10s.
These boots are perfect.
Ive hiked many canyons and mountains in them now and they held up great in both hot desert climate and winter snow and ice.
I used them for about 8 days straight in Iceland.
I bought these boots for a hiking trip to RMNP in Colorado.
Wore them for a couple hikes and the rubber front of the boot separated from the upper part of the shoe.
I expected a little better quality for only a few hikes after spending the money on what is usually a reputable brand.
Awesome fit!
Pues queda bien y si me gustan
La agujeta benia daada
Took about 2 days to break in but after that, it was comfortable even after SEVERAL hours of hiking.
The waterproof feature is also awesome!!
This design is very different from most other hiking boots.
I typically wear a size 8 but needed a 7.5 in these.
But these boots are AWESOME.
Another girl I work with had the same thing happened to her With the same boots.
I deliver mail on foot (13 miles) a day.
At the end of the first day I wore these I didnt have a blister or sore feet.
Very comfortable!!
I did size up so they were roomy for my thick socks.
I didnt have to break them in.
I really wanted to like these boots.
I work as a Ranger for a local Nature Center which means I need a good pair of boots that I can wear for long periods of time and they can handle the terrain.
I gave these boots a fair shot as I know sometimes you just have to break them in.
The second time I used thicker socks and used a Dr. Scholl  insert to see if it would help but I still ended up with not only blisters on my toes but now some on my heels.
The third time I wore band aids in advance and within an hour my toes were hurting and my heels had blisters.
I didnt care much for them in person and they were really narrow.
Ended up returning them.
They are sturdy, well-made and with some care and attention they will last for a very long time making it well worth the money.
These boots are very comfortable, and lightweight.
Because they are so comfortable, you dont mind having them on all day.
A
I wore these on our camping trip to Havasu Falls in Arizona 10
miles in and 10 out  and 10 around while we were there ...  and I Was the only one with out nasty blisters at the end of our trip ... I did wear them around for a few days before the trip to break them in .
.
Ansich solides Produkt, aber unfassbar unbequem durch einschneidende Knickfalte ber den Zehen
Not slip proof and you can slip while wearing them
Life saver for my hike out west
I bought these boots for winter hiking.
These boots were amazing!!
These were so comfortable on my first hike without even breaking them in.
They are light weight, comfy, and water repellent.
I purchased these boots for her for Christmas.These boots are waterproof, they are warm but ventilate well, they have a nice tread pattern which improves grip on all terrain.
They fit GREAT!
Bueno el producto justo lo que quera
Wore them to yosemite and it was snowing.
Dont order larger as if they are running shoes though.
The color is prettier than as pictured.
These were comfortable for about an hour and then I had to change shoes.
I needed something to wear while hiking and working and these do the job!
Muy bueno para hiking
Super comfortable - wore them all day for the first time and didnt need any time to break them in.
While hiking, I dont feel like my feet are going to slide off any rocks anymore.
Going hiking in a couple of days.
Wore them today and they broke in pretty well and pretty easily
I just bought them and intend to use them for hiking.
Light weight, comfy, waterproof and even a non-slip sole.
I love everything about these boots!
The reviews said they ran small so I ordered 1/2 size bigger than normal.
I am actually giving them to my daughter but I do plan to order another pair in my regular size for me.
This is an excellent hiking shoe.
Great shoes.
I wore them for the first time for 4 days straight at a music festival
I bought these boots before my trip to Iceland in September.
Most comfortable hiking boot I've owned.
Definitely my go to boot/shoe.
They do run large for sure.
No need to size up.
These boots have held up where well for the price and were waterproof tell now (put some work into them.)
My wife loves them.
Hermosas
Would have like more variety in colors
my daughter said they fit until she started walking.
I wanted to like this boot so much.
I purchased these hiking boots for an upcoming trip to the Smoky Mtns.
Last year, I learned a lesson
My husband bought the walking boots for Christmas.
I just recieved them.
Liked them.
These are my second pair.
Nice nice nice boots
I'm planning 2 10mile hikes in the Grand Canyon and will update my review when I return.
Used them on my 3 day adventure to the Adirondacks.
They were extremely comfortable.
Lightweight and comfortable, all in all a great experience.
Son muy cmodos y bonitos yo los uso para trabajar xq no resbalan son seguros
.
Quedaron perfectas, muy cmodas para las caminatas y mi tour en las cuevas de Cuetzalan
Because I knew I would be wearing heavy socks with them, I chose a half-size larger, but I think my regular size would have been just fine.
It is really Warm & comfortable.
.
I had bought these shoes 3 years ago and used them on the regular.
They finally served their time.
Perfecto
No blisters for me to break them in.
I usually wear a 7.5 shoe and bought a 7.5 boot.
Comfortable from the first day of wear.
I go on short hikes several times a week.
I have now been wearing these boots for more than a year.
I brought a brown pair first and they are very comfortable then I saw the black pair and brought them.
Size 8-1/2 fit perfect.
I've had these hiking boots for over a year.
I've been backpacking the whole time that I've owned them.
They are in fact waterproof.
Not a drop got through.These are very comfortable, and durable.
Better than I expected!
And truly is waterproof as I stood in a creek a bit higher than the ankle.
Fits great and comfortable
They hurt my feet at the top of the shoes really painful
Far better than spending the $150
on the NPS boots I needed
Maybe walking trails.
Be lucky to get these through one season.
I am a 7 & ordered a 7.
I would buy them again.
Great shoe.
Buscaba algo como principiante y creo que hice muy buena eleccin.
Lleg en buenas condiciones y antes de tiempo esperado
It is well constructed but is lacking a good insole
No dislikes
LOVE LOVE LOVE
Most people commented that the product ran small.
.
I really like it!
Tested it out for the first time in the snow.
I satisfied except somewhat rigid and hard feelings, so my ankle blistered.
But with thick socks, then it's okay to me.
Arrived fast...my daughter is in love with these boots
I bought them to traverse the icy/snowy campus every day in the winter.
I will write with updates for how they fare.
Good shoe replaced shoelaces though
I like the support this boot gives
They fit as expected otherwise.
I had to order a half size larger than I usually wear in shoes.
Hiked 2 national parks.
I ordered these boots and was expecting the usual Columbia quality.
If I were to order them again I would probably go up a half a size.
I considered ordering them in a wider width, but they were only available in brown - and I really like the gray color.
These shoes were one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.
Waterproof & comfortable
These boots are fantastic.
Very durable.
Great traction, extremely comfortable (don't pinch your toes), and water-resistant?
Buy them.
12/10 would recommend.
LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!
I have done some serious hiking in these and they are everything I could ask for.
First time I ever wore them was hiking through snow and my feet stayed dry and warm.
I was worried my fat toes would be tight so I got half a size larger.
Son cmodas y muy prcticas para practicar senderismo, me gustaron mucho.
I like that doesnt have a seam on the sides because it usually breaks.
Hiked up Cathedral Rock in Sedona and the South Kaibab trail at the Grand Canyon.
The boots had great traction and provided the ankle support I needed for those crazy up and down hill trails.
These are so comfortable.
I normally wear a 10,  but wanted a little extra room for winter socks so I ordered a 10.5.
Lacing is a cinch.
They have great traction for snow for heading to town, errands and going up and down hills with firewood on icy terrain.
I wore these shoes on hikes all over Iceland.
Very stiff but at first but very good once broken in.
#HikingLife
Bought them because of being waterproof.
Decent boot for the cost.
They fit perfectly but the longer I'm in them the less comfortable they become and I got blisters on the back heel.
Great
Like these.
I have huge feet.
I am a size 10 and sometimes need wide.
These boots are fairly narrow and would probably fit someone with lovely slender feet.
Just too tight.
otherwise ok.
they are waterproof.
after adding super feet supports they will work.
A little wide.
These boots are great!
Bought them to go hiking and also for the snow.
Bought these for a weekend trip to Maine for hiking (wore them briefly before I went).
By reading reviews, I purposely added a half size when ordering and am very glad I did.
They're everything I was looking for.
Excelentes, cmodos, me.
Encantaron
I get them wet daily and they are holding up great.
I have had them a few months now.
SUPER COMFY
Took them on an overnight backpacking trip, and that's when I decided I was done with them.
After a few miles my feet were killing me, even with my trusty Superfeet insoles, and having to hike the next day was brutal.
Missed Amazon's 30 day return policy, and am now shopping for new boots.
Like the fit.
These boots keep my feet dry and warm while off-roading.
10 mins into the snow and my toes were wet.
I got them because my much more expensive Merells always give me blisters, but these fit perfectly and didn't need much breaking in.
If you're planning on wearing thick socks, consider getting a half size up from your usual.
Maybe next time.
The fit of this shoe is more shoe than boot like.
Ordering a size up wasn't an option either, since the length of this shoe was perfect for me.
I wear them everyday
Full comfort even on my first big hike wearing them straight out of the box!
Absolutly amazing boots!
Would buy this product again.
Loves them!
My feet usually fit with size 7.5-8.
I read other reviews about this shoes and they said this shoe size is quite big compare to others.
So I orders two sizes and my feet fit in size 7.5.
I used it in my trip on snow and wet land.
It was really great.
These support your ankle well if you tie them up all the way to the top.
Put them on as soon as I received them and have been wearing them since.
Bought for my daughter to go hiking.
Great quality.
She normally wears a size 6 if that helps.
Trs satisfaite
Confortable
I wear these Newton Ridge almost daily at work in a casual work environment.
Ajusta perfecto
These boots are very comfortable and just perfect for light hiking.
I have been looking for a nice looking but comfortable hiking boot.
No fear of unwanted blisters.
Someone with a wider foot might need a different boot.
These are extremely comfortable!!
I bought a pair of Timberland boots and the Columbia boots are way more comfortable.
Not as comfortable as the sketchers
These boots are very comfortable.
My feet couldn't have been more comfortable.
Nice treading on the soles for great traction.
Finally got to wear my new shoes today.
Glad I bought them.
I just went on my first hike.
I felt stable even when we were walking on rocks.
Major bonus.
Being leather will take some breaking in but hopefully they will stand the test of time.
I've had these for a few months now.
They feel large and wide even after throwing in a pair of orthotics and heavy hiking socks.
I guess they were just "ok".
So far, they have proven to be waterproof.
I use them for yard work, fall fashion and protection.
Looking forward to seeing how they perform in snow going to and from work.
.
They do still get wet .
Excelente
Wore these shoes for a week hiking in Canada.
Im not sure what I can do in the future to prevent this.
The shoes are the correct size.
I like wearing them for walks and going out into the country.
I really like these boots.
I have wide feet and bought these in a size 10 which fit perfectly.
May have enough support for average arch height.
Comfortable.
I like that they are water proof.
Haven't tested yet.
This is the second pair of Columbia shoes bought.
Fits perfectly!!!
Product as described.
These boots are awesome!
My feet stayed completely dry.
Soooo comfy .
.
.
nope.
.
.
.
good ankle support
I wear a 9 in every type of shoe.
Wearing them as I type this review.
Cant wait to go hiking the Grand Canyon and Zion !!!
I bought these hiking boots for my daughter who recently moved to the mountains to attend college.
I have used them for mail walks with my city carriers and just recently used them on a trail walk.
I have been very satisfied with these so far .
.
This is my second pair of Columbia boots, I ordered 1/2 down this time because the first pair eventually stretched, this pair fit my arch perfectly
Recived a regular when i ordered a wide.
Also when the sun hits the shoe it feels like its cooking my feet because they get very hot.
Satisfaite, chaussure confortable beau look.
'  C' est la paire de hush puppies qui est trop troite.
Erreur, je donne 2 toile pour les hush puppies.
Thank you
slightly bigger than expected but super comfy and provide great support.
horrible foot bed.
They need to take some lessons from Merrill shoes.
I returned it and bought Merrills.
Good ankle support.
Not heavy.
I typically wear an 8.5-9 womens and I went with the 9 and it fits perfectly!
I bought for my daughter.
Love them didn't even have to break them in
GREAT boots.
Havent had much time for hiking but they seem good in back yard
Great for wooded trails.
They look a bit more trendy than the rubbery snow boots.
I initially tried changing the laces to ones that I could pull tighter, then tried removing the foam from the tongue.
It drives me nuts - I get everything in them from rocks to "stickers" to snow, which turns into a nice puddle in the bottom of my shoe!
True to size.
I wear thicker socks with them just because it feels better.
They are really good in mud and slick spots.
The price was on point.
Overall, I like the boots.
Completely recommended.
I bought these boots right before some serious hiking in West Virginia.
I waited two weeks before posting my review to be certain there were no issues.
My daughter wears this for climbing in the Adirondacks.
I've used them for environmental cleanups and hiking in Alaska, so far.
Kept my feet dry and comfortable while walking through standing water and slogging through mud at a Petit LeMans race.
Wouldn't recommend it for hikes longer than 8 hours.
I did have to return them to go up a size.
They were tight at first, but they are working out to fit just right.
I've used this product before when I bought it at an Columbia outlet years back.
Got a new pair for my wife and I for an upcoming trip.
Decided to buy online after I checked the price at a sporting store, I usually just buy there if I try there, but the price was over 50% higher.
Can't afford it these days.
Love the fact that it's water proof.
Im usually a size 8 but I purchased a 8 1/2.
I have wide feet
Just be sure to carry a few bandaids with you the first day you wear them, and pay attention to spots where they rub.
I'm quite pleased.
Can't wait to try them out on hikes.
Book
I also can use them at work and during inclement weather.
It seemed to be the case with mine as well.
Unfortunate, but maybe others will be luckier.
Very happy.
My first hike with them was in a rock field and I shouldve had them scuffed so many times, but they didnt get scuffed at all.
runs a little narrow, but these were for my daughter who has smaller feet (width wise) than me.
I saw customers posted pictures of these in Utah.
I was looking for hiking shoes for my Utah trip and bought these.
I love these hiking boots.
Wore the all day for full day of hiking.
I am a size 8 so I purchased a 8.5 but it was still a little tide around my toes.
Great
This is a great show.
However, I have very sensitive feet and it's difficult for me to find any shoe that doesn't hurt.
Comfortable foot bed!
I wear a 9, but sometimes need a 9-1/2 depending on style.
I really wanted to like these boots.
Just walking around my kitchen, it bends every time.
I cant imagine hiking like this.
Im sorry but will be returning.
And theyre light.
I wore it for my visit in April to Bryce Canyon and Zion National parks.
These run true to size and have a comfortable toe box while at the same time holding my very narrow heel.
I've worn a gray pair of these for about 8 months before finding the brown.
Good fit shoe for my wife
Comfortable and waterproof
I should have listened to other reviews.
I did like the colors and the high ankle support.
The fit was just off for me.
Breathable.
Exactly as described.
I like them I bought them for work, I'm on a concrete floor all day.
Snow, sand, rocks, even on a rainy day in Portland,OR.
just got the wrong size
I might have to buy her another pair soon .
She has them on so much.
Son perfectas
Wore these while hiking camelback mountain and exploring the Grand Canyon.
Fit as expected
Great Winter boots
Light weight.
Ease of slipping on.
Warm.
Water resistant.
Perfect for hiking or everyday use.
I wore it on a 2 hours hike on the mountain when I first got it.
I got compliments on them because they look nice too :)
Fit as expected
I had them for a while.
I love the convenience of throwing them on to run errands
Lightweight but sturdy
It is what i was expecting
Size 7 (US) is size 37 (Eu) for any shoe producer, except this one :( size 7 is the equivalent to 38 for them
Will have to look for weather proof spray.
My toes didn't freeze either.
No complaints!
Very sturdy, and fit as expected.
Thank you!
:)
Somebody said they were hot.
They are the most comfortable hiking boot I have ever worn.
They were comfortable to wear hiking and walking around in.
Great
Every step I took, the leather bent and hit my bug toe.
I took 5 steps and had to take them off.
Extremely uncomfrotable.
Light weight sturdy shoe
Us these a few days a week to work at our animal shelter.
Bought these because the last time I went hiking in running shoes, my ankle gave out and I ate dirt.
Or least fashionably offensive (ha).
Son cmodas, de inmediato que llegaron las use, se sienten comidas, ajustan bien a los pies, buena compra relacin precio, fcil de limpiar!!
Loved the boots!
Not super waterproof but it kept my feet warm enough?
Like all the other reviews, the toe box pinches at the top but it went away after one day or hiking.
Now theyre extremely comfy!
I wear a size 9 in most all boots and shoes, but these were 2 inches to long.
Marcher avec le chien dans le bois
Attractive shoe
was concerned about support, but the shoe is firm.
I spent allot of time researching what hiking boots to get and decided on these.
Even though they are hiking boots I know I'll wear these as one of my favorite casual shoes.
Lovin' these boots!
Nice colour!
I'm a size 11 but i ordered a size 12 to give me some extra room for my thick soaks.
I order these boots since i went on a hiking trip in December and there were snow.
This is my second pair.
The first pair is now my working ones and these will be more for "dress".
Love the fact that the boot is so light on the foot, makes for easier walking!
It is value for the price.
Bought these one size larger than I usually buy and they fit perfectly.
Bought a pair of Columbia winter boots last year and ordered them exact size i wear and they were a little tight so i ordered these one size larger.
Fit exactly my size.
Solamente me qued grande, an pidiendo mi nmero habitual.
These do run big.
Usually a 8.5 but went with an 8 and wore thick hiking socks.
These shoes are very comfortable and just what I was needing for small trail hikes.
They broke in very easy and are very comfortable and light weight.
LOVE LOVE LOVE these boots!
I wore them for 5 days straight 10 hours a day without blisters.
I am breaking them in so we'll see if that works.
Wore these an entire day the first time out of the box.
They run true to size.
I work in an office but do outside site visits also.
Look more like a casual shoe and I love that about them!!
My feet remained warm all day!
.
Not super bulky which I love.
True to size and super cute!
1st time ordering these boots, have had Columbia light trail shoes before so know the brand.
Comfortable fit.
Good value
My mom and sister in law are both now planning to buy them.
True to size.
I generally wear a 9.
I like these boots for the fit.
And I think they'll work fine for wearing in the snow and light walking.
I purchased them last minute for a trip to Colorado.
Fit to size.
Amazing.
Works great and fairly comfortable
Perfect for trekking around Iceland!
if you're looking to buy these go a half size up.
That said, when walking the boots crease over your toes and really dig in although they seem to fit initially
I would like to exchange my product.
Also, it came with two different size shoe laces.
I expected better from the padding.
Be aware the fit runs a little big
Minor inconvenience.
These hiking boots are exactly what I was looking for.
Perfect fit.
Yea!
Ordered a half size up and they fit great.
Great quality.
A job to hike in.
My daughter works as a guide at Red Mountain Park.
She does hiking anf zip line tours.
I like it.
So confortable.
Right fit
LOVE these boots.
Comfortable for hiking and walking.
Super happy!
Although Im sure these are really nice boots the pair I purchased looked as though they had been worn and returned.
I will use it for hiking.
After about mile 6 or 7 of a 10 mile hike, the toenails on my big toes seemed to be becoming bruised.
I believe this is due to the "toe crease" others have complained about.
Seems to be a reoccurring issue with the toe crease.
Comfortable out of the box.
Wore them non stop from the moment I put them on.
I got them for walking my dog.
No more wet socks!
I needed a weatherproof boot that I could wear all day.
these fit just as expected.
Would purchase again.
These were doing great, until month number two.
The sole is coming off of the shoe.
There should be at least a 6 month period before anything like this happens.
?
I wear these for camping and hiking.
Currently breaking them in for Iceland!
I would recommend them to anyone.
Wore these while hiking through the mountains in Monte Verde, Costa Rica during the rainy season (in October).
Didn't slip once.
Love these boots, already walked almost 300km in them and theyre going strong
Gr8
They look great on me, with whatever I wear (whether it's jeans or tights or hiking pants)!
They are sturdy when I go hiking.
Im a big nature bunny and they fit perfectly.
I took them with me on my trip to Iceland and many other hikes.
Not only are they very comfortable but they are stylish as well.
These boots are light-weight and comfortable.
Fit as expected.
The boots pinch the top of my big toes where they bend as I step.
I'll have to keep them because I have used them,so I'll revise this review if they do indeed become more comfortable.
They fit true to size but very hard and need brake in period .
So I needed a new pair and thought again to columbia.
So I returned them and got another brand.
PERFECT fit
Exactly as advertised.
The quality of the product is excellent, but they are small!
Great hiking boots
Perfect fit!
WOhooo- I got the best boots ever- I was not expecting the quality would be so good as the price was relatively cheaper than others.
I received my shoes today and I was planning on using them on a trip in two days.
Not really sure what I am going to do now.
I hiked the camino in Spain and have done many a mile in them.
They where definetily waterproof and comfortable.
They are thick.
most comfortable hiking boots ever!!!
can wear all day and are waterproof!!!!
Very good quality.
Wore these recently on a trip to Switzerland.
I like that they are waterproof and were comfortable from my first walk in them
Comfortable
I finally got around to buying a pair and they seriously pinch my toes!
Not sure if this problem will go away as they get worn in but I am highly dissapointed.
Perhaps the design doesn't work on smaller sizes?
This boot is everything I need for hiking - thick rubber sole, great ankle support and waterproof!
I will probably order another pair!
Great shoe, very stable and fits true to size.
Does require some breaking in.
Didnt have to break into it, wore it during my entire hike in AZ!!
These are really good ????????
Comfortable to wear.Returning size 8
You have to almost completely undo all of the laces.
LOVE these boots!
Ni una excusa, medidas, material, color, textura, todo perfecto.
Son cmodas para traer todo el da, son ligeras
They are light weight but tough.
Que son perfectos para el fro Y los voy a utilizar en el trabajo
Wore my new Columbia hikers for the first time yesterday for a 4 mile hike.
They were pretty comfortable.
They kept my feet dry even walking through a small stream.
These boots are most definitely waterproof!
I bought these same boots 3 years ago.
The new ones are proving to be as good as the old ones.
This is the second pair I order on amazon (first pair were Timberlands that I returned) and I dont know if its me or what, but they hurt around the ankles!!
Breaking them in didnt work.
They fit perfectly but once you start walking it hurts like heck around ankles.
My feet stay completely dry.
Light weight shoes.
Im either a 7.5 or an 8.
I leaned to an 8 since everyone said having some room would be nice for layering!
Excelente para largas caminatas
Nice looking boot!
Would recommend as an economical choice
These boots were super comfortable from day one.
These would be great boots for the casual hiker.
At first, they were waterproof, fit well, and had decent traction, but only later about 3 months.
.
.
Have a pair I've had for 5 years.
Glad I found another pair.
Great boot!
Lleg en el tiempo estimado
Muy bonitos, cmodos y ligeros....
I wear a size 8 but have a wide foot.
These boots are AMAZING!!!!
Must have!!!!
This is a very supportive boot.
I'll see if maybe I can break them in a bit and fix the issue?
Had to go buy a new pair of shoes from a different brand for work.
?
Great shoes.
I really wanted to like these boots.
!!
These boots were exactly what I was looking for style-wise.
My daughter went hiking with it, she loved it.
.
which made me happy.
Many blisters trying to break them in.
Fit was great, enough room for thick socks but easy to tighten when you dont need them.
Exactly what I needed for my upcoming trip.
Scuff very easily.
Usually  buy Sketckers.
I thought this was a  premium brand.
Very disappointed.
Estn geniales!!
Not comfortable if wearing for over 10 hours.
Use these as work boots in the fall/ winter weather.
Excelente
Perfect boots.
I liked them very much.
I read all the comments and most of them says that the boots run big.
I also wish that they were leather lined.
Recommended.
I really wanted to like this shoe, but no luck.
I will buy more.
Son cmodos y la medida excelente muy bien los zapatos
Firs great and very comfortable.
I walk 10 hours with these shoes.
They are a glove.
The front formed a deep crease that DUG INTO MY BIG TOES AND WAS PAINFUL to wear for even 5 minutes.
Hiked in Iceland.
Rain and puddles on trails .
They look great and they are light.
SO COMFORTABLE RIGHT AWAY!
Not wide enough so they need sizes in wide
They're cute though
Like them bunches.
I'm a female truck driver.
I bought these for a work boot.
These boots are light and comfortable.
love the boots little big just have to wera heavier socks
Great fit!
Cant wait to try them out in Sedona!!
great for hikinglook great!!
Allow room for socks.
I would and will buy again
Comfortable from moment I put them on.
Used this every where we hike.
Excellent
Happy with the purchase
I LOVE IT!
Just what I expected.
Ordered a half size up and these are PERFECT.
Simply the hiking shoes I need .
.
This is her 5th pair in last 7 years.
Got this for Machu Picchu hike.
Great quality and my fianc was very happy with the design and durability.
I originally ordered my regular size of an 8 M.
I normally a size7-7.5 so I went ahead and got a 7.5 and they fit great!
Good quality and great fit.
Were comfortable from the first wearing - a 3 hour walk/easy hike in Costa Rica.
Not really a hiker but I needed something for walking the dog in the woods, snow, mud, etc.
Boots are light and appear to be well made.
Hard to get work boots in womens sizes.
I have bought these boots twice.
They fit great.
Arrived before my shift.
Comfy!
They didnt even have to be broke in.
My grand daughter asked for these boots for hiking.
Initially the hiking boot felt comfortable but after hiking in them, it kept rubbing at the base of my toes.
Due to how the boot is stitched under the shoe laces, it creates a bend in the boot at the base of the toes area that will rub/cut/blister your foot.
You get what you pay for so invest in a quality pair of hiking boots.
Comfortable from the get-go.
Easy on and off.
Cute!
I bought it for hiking in the mountains.
Planning to use them on my next trip to Alaska.
What can I say!!
This product is excellent
They keep your feet dry and the leather molds to your feet.
Buy them!
Great
I have ordered these boots many times.
Fits great!
These are super comfortable on my feet.
No support.
My feet hurt not even an hour into my hike.
.
Love.
Went on several hikes through mud and river crossings.
I bought these to use as work boots at the orchard.
Didn't have to break them and there are so comfortable!
I ordered some timberland boots originally but returned them because they weren't very comfortable.
.
these are so much better.
Would buy again.
Would definitely buy again
Wore them straight out of the box.
Walk 10 miles a day for work.
Went half size bigger tho.
My 2nd pair.
I use them for work.
They also rub uncomfortably against my Achilles tendon, causing swelling.
Break them in before hiking or you will regret it :(
I flexed the toe box a few times and wore the shoes around the house for a few hours.
Problem solved.
However, after 4 uses the front part of the sole unglued and water comes a little bit inside now.
Right out of the box comfort!
Everything was as expected.
Very pleased.
Wore all day walking several days in a row
I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.
I wore these for all of 20 steps in my home.
How did they let these onto the sales floor?
So disappointing.
I usually have so much faith in Columbia products.What happened?
I was really hesitant to get my actual size 10 due to the fit.
I bought these to wear for work where Im on my feet all day.
I might as well be standing barefoot on concrete all day for the amount of padding and support these boots provide.
Im actuaclly going to have to find other boots for work even though I just bought these a couple months ago.
Bought them to hike in the hills.
Had to buy more support for shoes .
only wore for 2 to 3 weeks.
im putting them to the test of at least 3 miles a day.
Literally wore these non-stop for a week.
Kinda wish they had them in brown when I ordered though
Todo
I love these so much :)
GOOD SHOE!
GREAT LOOK!
It's to hot but they are vary water proof like vary water proof
Also they are waterproof!
Great boots, great fit.
With each step the toe of the boot would crease into the top of my foot.
Great boot.
Took it out as soon as I got it.
Felt great and looked great.
These shoes are so comfy!
I wore mine around campus for about two weeks to break them in.
Great fit and comfortable.
My size runs between 8.5 and 9 in Womens.
I have been looking and trying on hiking shoes for 5 years.
I purchased these boots to wear to work- I am a gardener in a city park- most walking on asphalt or soil.
Nothing that would qualify as rugged terrain.
.
and yet!
After six months of regular wear these boots are totally destroyed- I can see my socks through the lining where the outer and inner have completely ripped and separated from the bottom of the shoe.
The synthetic outer was the first to go, ripping at the toe box and then slowly across the entire boot.
.
Excelente se recomienda
Dont even need to break in.
Extremely pleased
I use orthotics in them for greater arch support.
These boots are extremely comfortable as well as supportive going up and down hills.
Amazing shoes!
Wore them every day in California and hiked multiple mountains, bluffs, and deserts!
They are definitely water proof!
Ich habe diesen Schuh fr einen Wander-Urlaub in Schottland gekauft.Er war der einzige Schuh, der sehr stabil, robust und zugleich sehr leicht war.Selbst nach einem halben Jahr intensiver Benutzung "lebt" er immer noch.
Ich bin begeistert.Wrde ich mir auf jeden Fall noch einmal kaufen!Tipp: Wanderschuhe sollte man mindestens eine Schuhgre grer bestellen!
Wore these brand new shoes hiking up over 6,500 feet above sea level in Zion National Park.
Normally an 8 or 8.5
The build quality is otherwise very nice, but I returned these.
These  boots are awesome.
Just make sure you wear thick socks when you try breaking them in.
These came a little bigger than I thought but still do able.
.
I wear size 6 and they fit perfectly!
They feel sturdy and comfortable.
Wore all day on the first day.
I like the design and how it fit, and the lightness!!
Me quedaron bien son muy comodos
Para hacer deporte de montaa
Gave one away and other pair I tossed because of extreme poison oak
Fits comfortably used for hiking.
Relacin calidad - precio es perfecta.
Muy cmodas desde el primer dia de que las ocup.
Fit as expected.
Super comfy.
Fit like a glove
They did not hold up.
Within 6 months the leather separated from the soul.
Amazon only gives one month to return.
These were amazon's choice, waterproof.
Fulfilled by amazon.
These boots are extremely comfortable.
I thought I had to break them in, but they were so comfortable after wearing them all day.
100% exactly size conform
I would definitely recommend buying these.
Really like this boot, very sturdy!!
Product was just as I expected
belle botte
They rub!
Break these in BEFORE your expedition.
I wore them for a 30minute hike and had several blisters :(
After wearing out my first pair, I purchased the same boots again.
Exactly what I needed and wanted.
True to size.
Boot runs on the wide side.
...?
I liked them
they were not wide enough.
Perfectas, vienen amplias y son muy cmodas
Great hiking boots.
It was really water proof.
Have been using it for a few months now, its exactly what I wanted!
Uncomfortable immediately on wear, arrived 2 days late as well.
Reviews confirm, shouldve read more carefully
Will buy again!
bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.
I like it.
I sent them back before Christmas
I needed ankle and arch support but wanted something lightweight and that is exacty what I got.
.
LOVE these boots!!
Getting ready to order a "back up" pair.
Me agrado,de muy buena calidad
I also like the way they look.
Lightweight.
Used for work
They were exactly as described.
Now if they wouldn't come untied.
confortable
They are exactly what you see in the picture
Fit well and incredibly comfortable
Me encantaron, son muy cmodas, ligeras y resistentes
I wore these shoes on a 4 day hiking trip, by the end of the first hour of hiking the stitching had already rubbed into the top of my big toes.
The second day of hiking presented with massive blisters on my pinkie toes.
Lo que necesitaba mi esposa
Bought these for our trip to The Black Forest in Germany.
Wore these all day hiking through the forest and walking through the streets of town.
Great shoe.
Very comfy, waterproof boots!
Fits as expected!!!
the way they look.
Dicks & Bass Pro is selling the same shoe for $80.
Comfortable, true to size, light weight yet sturdy.
Look new!
The support is excellent.
They wipe clean very easily and are very water resistant.
They're definitely water proof!
No squishy wet socks!!!
This is my second pair of Columbia Hiking boots.
I had my first pair since 2008.
They finally wore out.
Best purchase off the year.
Fits as expected, some reviews say size up but I got 7.5 as a usual 7.5 and fits perfect!
My wife in love.
Wear 8, purchased 9.
I like shoes with wiggle room.
These shoes are very light and have lots of toe room for thicker socks.
I returned them.
Perfect fit.
Fabulosas!!
When you walk the top of the boot crushes your toes, so I returned them
Love.
If you  step in a puddle while crossing it you will be OK.
If you walk in wet grass for 2 hours your feet (and these boots and your socks) will be soaked through and through.
Perfect for my dayli use.
Boots fit great and are very comfortable.
Toe box was tight and punched my toes
Fits greater than expected.
Built to last.
I used them for trekking.
I like it all.
The boots are glued together, not stitched, and poorly at that.
Using it from more than an year.
Amazing!
Comfy and sturdy
They are very comfortable
I bought these with the intent of using them on a snow backpacking trip over the weekend.
These boots passed the test on being waterproof and warm.
Excellent grip and comfort.
went hiking in snow.
Did not get wet!!
Awesome and comfortable!!
Comfortable,warm, not bulky.
I went hiking in North Carolina they were so comfortable great boot
Es muy bonito el botn
Love these boots!!
Thank you for being so prompt in sending them.
Love these hiking boots
They are a little bully but provide good support and feel durable.
Love its durability, support, protection, and easy maintenance.And yes, they look good too.
You must break these in.
The boots were exactly as described.
nothing fancy.
Size fits great but definitely slip a lot more than expected even after all the reviews on it
Would definitely buy again.
Love love love
I wore these during a trip to Switzerland for a glacier walk.
They were extremely comfortable.
Nanasn
Muy cmodos, medida perfecta y prcticos para el trabajo cotidiano
Small
I ordered a size 9 and wore them around for part of the day only to discover that my toes were being pinched on the top by a crease in the toe area caused by walking.
I ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear to accommodate thicker socks, but they still cut off circulation to my feet.
Its a killer!
Disappointed.
Hiking in Sedona
.
Wearing them tomorrow for first day at work.
I wanted something sturdy yet comfortable, and I got exactly that!
Love the boots.
Like the fit
I have wide feet, fortunately these boots give, I will keep & use them for hiking.
oh my god....shoes
I return it.
They arrived dirty, scratched very much used.
Totally unacceptable.
The shoes are expensive and to receive them in that condition is terrivke.
I dont think it will hold up.
I wear a size 6 shoe usually and I bought 6.5.
It fit well and is very comfortable.
I would advise to buy half size up.
Love there boots!
Perfect fit!
Like these and have received a couple of complements already!
Very light weight too!
Great productFits well
Smaller then the last pair I wore.
Perfect fit
Me encantaron
Went hiking in Oregon and Washington through rain and snow with these.
Held up great and kept my feet dry
Wore this on an 8 hour hike, it started hurting my toes only after a couple hours and I also got blisters on the back of my feet.
I wouldn't recommend these boots to anyone with slightly wide feet and I would wear higher socks than ankle socks.
Style
They get scruffy looking pretty fast but so far they feel really good and serve my purpose on a hike.
I wear a 7 shoe but purchased 7 1/2 boots.
Excelente tabla de medidas
The top of the shoe creases and digs into the toes with every step.
It rubbed the skin off the tops of my toes!
Ouch!
This is the second pair I bought.
The first ones lasted about 2 walking seasons.
I walk approx. 3-5 miles a day.
Too big.
Excelentes muy cmodos
Muy buenas zapatillas.
Work
They are easy to care for and have thus far held up through the storm.
The size of the boots were as they should be but the tow is very narrow inside and the insole very hard.
These boots are great fit to size wore then in bad weather in NY and they keep my feet warm and dry.
.
i got these for my wife.
Buen material resiste al abuso del terreno.Recomendado
This is my 2nd pair.
I'm a mail carrier.....they get used!
.
Not this one!
Excellent product excellent price
The comfort level of these boots is incredible.
Slippery trails are no problem!
Have had to take them off during hikes because of this.
Stock up on extra socks and band aids for when you wear these.
Returned this product.
I dont know why people said to size up.
I PURCHASED THESE BOOTS  Ordered on November 16, 2020.
BEYOND FRUSTRATING.
LESSON LEARNED
They really do crease over the top of the toes and it cuts like a knife.
I'm normally a size 9 and ordered size 9
Es fiel a su talla, son cmodas y muy buena calidad
Too tight around the toe box.
I had previously purchased these same type of boots in the past and they are very comfortable and I wear them to work every day.
Use for mowing and yard work.
Cute
They pinch at the toe.
Every time Id take a step, itd pinch my toes where all of our feet bend.
Not worth the money.
Shoes are tearing from the sides and I've only had them for a little over a month.
waking
I like everything.
Exactly as described.
Used them on my recent vacation in the Smokies.
Pretty waterproof.
Comfortable, dry and durable.
Un poquito grande
They fit as expected and really hold up over time.
I would definitely get them again!
Comfortable
Lightweight and cushioned.
Nice
It fit great.
The bend pushes against your toes.
they are very comfortable
Comfortable.
Ok
Did hikes, sight seeing, looong trekking and they worked perfectly!
I wanted to like these boots.
They were my first hiking boots.
The one thing I liked about them was they made my foot look small.
I wear a 10.
Had to return.
Now a little scared to order another hiking boot.
Great quality.
Just what expected
They are water proof and light.
Cute
Cant wait to try them out in South Africa.
Excelente!
Medida exacta y en muy buenas condiciones, recomendado!
Son muy cmodas y adems se ven muy bien.
Sirven para escalar, caminar y resistentes al agua.
LOVE THEM!!!
I am so glad that I splurged for myself and got myself these boots.
The are, oh, so comfy!
I am looking forward to ordering other colors.
Did well in Peru
Me gustaron justo lo q buscaba
I have bought this boot for me and my wife to use it in a 0 degree C (32 F) and to walk on snow.
I'm gonna try the meshy looking boots :)).
Cheap
Good support for a hike
Good looking shoe!!!
good for my flat feet
I've used them for hiking as well as just walking around town.
I have to say that for hiking boots they are really light but that's where my compliments end.
And then I was wondering what the material of these shoes really were.
Wore these on several long hiking trips in the mountains.
These came fast.
Went fishing and they kept my feet warm.
I really wanted to like these boots.
The front toe area of the shoe bends inward with each step and rubbed the top of my big toe raw.
I even had two pairs of thick socks on.
I will say the return process was extremely easy and quick.
Comfortable and ankle support I needed!
I think for the price they should last longer.
Then 4 months.
Love this boots
Thank you for fast delivery!
Good hiking boots.
Fit as expected, Hugh quality, durable.
Las tallas vienen perfectas.
They are what I wanted!
Excelente calidad, precio , son ligeras .
Impermeables.
Cmodos
It looks good and fits good.
Purchased for my wife, she says they are the most comfortable boots she ever had.
These are my new rain boots.
Very stylish!
Plastic uppers.
You are an American company.
Make your product in AMERCIA
Excelent
I work outside.
Today was the first day it rained.
My feet are soaked.
My feet where wet within 10 minutes.
Worse boots i have ever bought.
And I buy a lot of boots.
If you wear these in the rain your feet WILL BE WET.
Only wore them a couple of times so far but they are comfortable.
gave me blisters
100% recomendable.
De buena calidad excelente para caminar en campo abierto
?
The shoes are sold as waterproof.
I am in the park daily, quite often walking on wet grass.
Water seeps into the boot seam between the rubber sole and soft material covering the top of the foot.
Very sturdy and water tight with excellent treads for winter.
Then I went on a 10 mile hike with thicker socks and they rubbed the back of my heels raw and caused a blister on the top of my foot near my toe.
My arches hurt too.
Como y muy ligero
Great
Muy buenas botas sper cmodas ped la misma talla que uso en tenis y me quedaron sper bien si las recomiendo
Fits as expected.
It fits just as I expected
I bought them for a hiking trip to Glacier.
After the 3rd day I noticed the rubber on the toe was separating from the shoe.
Then I noticed he sides were coming apart from the shoes.
Ridiculous.
Great quality
Great product.
Great fit.
Great price
Worst shoes ever.
Por comodos
I wear a size 9 and these are about a size 81/2 easy.
Loved the fit
I checked Colombias site which shows their emblem on the back of the shoe along with other sites.
I believe these are fakes.
Me encantaron son muy cmodos para trabajar
Para mi todo bien
UN BUEN Y CMODO ARTICULO
These are my 3rd pair of Columbia boots.
hiked 3 miles in them the first time I wore them.
Good shoes
They were returned.
They look great and the support is there, but the comfort is not.
Buen producto
Muy comodas!!
Resisten el agua, pero cuando las tuve que meter por completo, se secaron rpido.
Waterproof for sure!
The first step I took changed my mind.
I wanted to live these boots, but theyre going back.
They were great for a couple months, but the bottom sole started coming apart from the top.
They fell apart pretty fast.
Great shoe!
Perfect fit!
I bought these for hiking the grand canyon.
Rocks somehow kept entering the boot.
Very minimal traction.
Perfect fit.
Great
I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.
I will be returning the pair.
Also, every time you take a step the front creases and digs into the top of your foot.
I tried two different sizes (my normal size 8 and then 8.5) and the crease happened both times.
Comfortable and supportive foe long hikes.
I tried two sizes and it happened with both.
Had high hopes for these boots because of all the high reviews.
Me llegaron super rpido, la talla fue la que ped y adems son muy bonitas.
Super recomendadas.
Love these boots comfy, waterproof, durable!
Not true to size.
Very narrow, but had good cushion in the heel
Perfect shoes!
Fit as expected!
Thank you
This really bummed me out.
Do yourself a favor and go with a different boot
Comfortable and light-weight boots.
I like them very much.
What more to ask for?
My toes get wet.
It was supposed to be water proof.
Didnt even have them for a week and the lace holder popped off otherwise very comfortable
I got these shoes for hiking with my grandchildren in Colorado.
I read the suggestions and sized up and they fit great!
Perfect
They also are comfortable to wear without hurting my feet.
I would have prefer it to be size 10 wide
Legit!
Within just a few steps I felt the boot hitting the top of my toe.
Love the boots !!!
Me encantaron estas botas, son ligeras y muy cmodas adems de ser estticas pues son muy bonitas
Comfortable right out of the  box, super light weight!
Will buy again.
Returning
Hiking in Montana for two days in these boots.
This is my 2nd pair.
Comfortable all-day wear.
Perfectas
Love the color, and the fit.
Needs a break-in period.
After first wearing the balls of my feet hurt a bit.
Only thing I can tell honestly is Order at least a size down.
Comfortable boots
I like how it looks and feel.
fit somewhat small...
No trouble breaking them in and very comfortable.
Me encantaron, son justo lo que necesitaba.La talla me ajusto genial de acuerdo a la tabla de tamaos.
Finally Found The Perfect Hiking Boot.
It is waterproof.
Great shoes.
Tal como esperaba.
Wife says fit great
Love
Love these hiking boots!!!
Thank you
ready to kick ass!
Comfortable and lightweight.
Little bit of rubbing on the back of my heel but that should ease up once they get broke in.
Perfectos
jerry just forget it
Disappointed.
You need to get half size bigger
They're very comfortable.
These are my "go to" boots for everyday winter days!!
?
I spent weekend walking.
So glad I purchased.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these boots!
So much so my skin was rubbed off!
Right where the shoe bends/creases.
comfortable and keep your feet dry
Muy comodas
These boots are great.
Great hiking boots.
Fit perfectly, couldn't be happier!
Thank you!
I wanted these to work.
They look great, but they pinched my toes severely.
I tried different socks thicknesses .
I still ended up with bruises.
awesome hikers light weight sturdy great price
Still going strong after 2.5 years
Pequeas
:(
A la medida, todo excelente
Fit great!
Durable
very comfortable and perfect for hiking.
The quality is excellent.
They chaff your ankles.
Great Boot!
I returned these because the rubber part on the toe rubs on your toes when you bend your foot .
Which I was kinda expecting from all the other reviews .
No way walking in these are comfortable
Bought for my wife.
Comfortable, waterproof as advertised.
I thought the leather would stretch over time.
:(
It killed my feet.
I specifically selected this pair because of the blue logo and material on the back of the shoe.
Great boot.
Took them out this weekend.
The wife fell in love with them.
Not worth the price.
Loooove these boots!
The toe area has an added/separate pc if leather going across the toes.
Giving the appearance of steel toe.
This seam digs into the toes.
Causing blisters on the top of toes.
She said they are very comfortable.
Great product!
Speedy responses!
Excellent
They are waterproof, Ill give them that.
The grip is absolutely terrible!
These boots keep my feet warm and dry!
Exactly what I was looking for and needed.
Thank you Columbia!
More than I expected, I really like my new shoes
Warm, great fit, very comfy.
Estn muy padres y cmodos
These shoes leak
These hiking boots look great, but I had the toe issue that many people had.
Returned
Good ankle support and stability.
They are very light weight and comfortable.
Everything
My daughter has fallen and scraped her knees terribly (twice!)
in the one week she has been wearing these.
The metal pieces holding the laces catch on the other boot causing her to fall!
good quality
Looks dressier than all the other designs.
LOVE!
I wear these boots all the me.
the way they are made it will last probably the rest of my hiking life
Perfect for rain, hiking, and outdoor activities!
I bought a pair of new hiking boots but what I got was a pair of USED hiking boots.
Perfect as expected.
These boots are great.
Gift for the wife.
When walking the boot cut across my toes, where the natural bend is in the front of the shoe when you walk.
Stiff toe box.
Uncomfortable.
These hiking shoes arrived full of mold!
Lived up to the description on Amazon.
Muy buena calidad
Comfortable boot, water resistant.
Fits like they're supposed to.

These boots are very good looking.
Muy recomendables y en comparacin con otros productos similares a muy buen precio.
Voor tweede keer besteld en betaald, weer niet goed!
Andere Columbia schoenen die ik heb passen me allemaal goed, of zijn zelfs wat aan de grote kant.
Deze schoenen zijn echter een stuk smaller.
Bestel dus minstens een maat groter dan je gewend bent bij Columbia schoenen.
Dus heb je maat 43 met Columbia, Timberland, PME Adidas, Puma, Nike of NB, bestel dan maat 44.
De schoenen zijn netjes afgewerkt en zien er goed en degelijk uit.
Goed profiel, en niet te harde zool, dus goede grip.Het enige negatieve is dus de maat.
Misschien ben ik erg streng door 2 sterren af te trekken.
Echter Columbia schoenen vallen normaal ruim en zijn bij uitstek geschikt voor mensen met brede voeten.
Je krijgt dus niet wat je verwacht.
Goeie pasvorm, stevige zolen, waterdicht.
Te klein bij de neus en te smal!
A hiking shoe should be large, this one is smaller than a normal shoe.
(Size 40)
