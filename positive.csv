I love these so much, I am going to buy a second pair to stash away for when this pair wears out in case I can't find them again.
No blisters, sore spots, foot odor, or especially important, no sore knees at the end of the day!
We were hiking in mostly cool, arid conditions in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico.
They've been terrific, gripping the ice well and keeping my feet warm and dry.
They are still in great shape.
Strongly recommend!
With a pair of smart wool socks and a very thin gel insert, the 8 was way too small.
Even without the gel insert and just the smart wool socks, it was still too narrow for my comfort, especially when it came to my toes.
For reference, my toe width is about 3.8cm, so if your feet are that wide or wider, definitely size up and or get the wide version.I reordered an 8.5 wide since these didnt fit, and Ill probably update this review those come in.UPDATE 04-03-2023:The 8.5 wide came in and they fit perfect with the smart wool socks and a gel insert!
It looks like they didnt widen the tongue of the shoe along with the sole, so Im not sure how well it will do at keeping water out.
Also hiked the Grand Canyon two weeks later with microspikes over these and was extremely happy with how rugged but lightweight they were.I tried some VERY expensive Danner/Oboz boots in REI and these felt a million times more comfortable, even though I honestly wanted the others just for appearance.I usually hike mountains in sneakers but needed something warm, so feeling like my ankle wasnt locked in place was a must.
Theyre supportive but flexible and Im really happy I went with these, already helped make some great memories!
Wow.
To my pleasant surprise, they are very adjustable with an appropriate amount of space around the toe area.
As far as quality, out of the box they seem nice, light, not sure if light is a good thing with hiking boots, but seems good.
Color combo (black with red laces) is cool.
Definitely recommend.
Went right to hiking 6.5 miles the first time I wore them.
Provided great ankle support.
We loved them.
I volunteer to build houses and these boots are comfortable, supportive and keep feet a perfect temp (didn't sweat or get cold).
Loved so much, bought a second pair.
I recently purchased these hiking boots and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance.
These boots are not only comfortable to wear, but they also provide excellent support and protection on the trails.I highly recommend these hiking boots to anyone looking for a light, comfortable and reliable pair of hiking boots.
They are well-made, durable, and provide excellent support and protection on the trails.
So I tried on the boots and they fit perfect.
The quality is great.
They really grab the ground well so you don't slip, the red is very contrasting to the black, and they are comfortable.
I went right into two 9 hour days with them.
The soul is comfortable and I like how they lace up high so they stabilize the ankle if you wanted. 
They fit me the same as my other Columbia boots so I'd say the size is true to fit.
I needed shoes suitable for walking the dog so I ordered 4 different pairs.
I would prefer a bit more grip in them (in the snow/ice so maybe Im asking too much) & the laces didnt last very long but these are tiny details for a shoe I enjoy so much.
I love everything about this boot....very very comfortable...and VERY durable!
We camped and hiked for 5 days...it was very wet weather.
Good shoe but...the insole is very hard so you will need to buy extra insoles that are comfortable.
I got the dark brown style and I was so happy with them, they look great from the start, havent hiked in them yet but Ill update when I do but they were very comfy when I tried them on!
They felt comfortable to walk in.
Broke in these hiking boots on a 6 mile hike, and I got 0 blisters and felt like I had great ankle support the entire time.
The hike was in the snow and my feet stayed warm and dry the entire time.
Bought these boots to go hiking at zion National Park, they fit well and were comfortable.
These are great!
Highly recommend.
Love this hiking shoe!
Durable, comfortable, and very stable.
Very good value.
I had no problem love the pickup.
Everything went great.
These are great so far on medium grade hikes and definitely waterproof.
My ankle tends to roll and sprain easily when stepping on uneven surfaces which is one reason I've been hesitant to hike but these give a really good grip and they're making me more confident.
I love these boots.
Strong and tough for hiking.
I love them!
I picked size 9 because that is my regular size on all my shoes and they fit perfect!
I also have plantar fascitis and these shoes are so comfortable, and yes, they are waterproof.
Unsure how well they will hold up, my job ruins shoes in a matter of months.
After adding a sole insert and wearing thick socks they fit well.
Good price.
Happy with my purchase and would buy again!
I ordered my normal size, 8.5 and they are a true fit and extremely comfortable!
The grips on the bottom feel great.
I love these.
Definitely would recommend
So happy I did because they provided great support, kept my feet dry, and allowed me to comfortably navigate the terrain.
Priced well for what you get.
Overall great boot.
My first ever pair of hiking shoe and theyre true to size.
Way cuter in person as well!
Definitely recommend them!
These are the best shoes I have ever purchased!
Reliable, very cute, easy to put on and take off, and my feet stayed dry the entire time!
I didn't break them in prior to my trip, but that was perfectly fine as they were comfortable immediately.
It was soo comfortable
Whether it's walking outside in the winter through slush or hiking on the trails, these versatile shoes are the perfect fit for your outdoor needs!
Comfy right out of the box!
Would definitely recommend these hiking boots!
I bought these boots to take to Alaska on the land and sea vacation.
Perfect fit and feel great on my feet!
Love them!
I knew that Columbia boots fit perfectly and is a great quality!
Waterproof and the right price!
I do plan to upgrade to other boots soon but these are great entry level boots.They are water resistant in my experience, not waterproof.
Stepping in one big puddle of water will be fine.
Wet rocks and vertical scrambles on wet rocks is fine.
Great ankle support.
Wide show as well which I love.
Great hiking shoes !
These hikers are waterproof and very comfortable.
Traction not great but good for everyday hiking.
Exactly as the photo, comfortable, true to size.
Love them!
Its perfectly comfortable for the 1-3 hours I wear them at a time.
Highly suggest, especially for the price
I wear them to work and they provide the right arch and ankle support.
Shoes fit perfect so comfy first time out was hiking in the snow in Sequoia and they kept my feet dry.
They are so comfortable and looked great!
Comfortable right out the box.
it's a good looking shoe not bulky
This style was cheaper then the other two I had purchased and were of great quality.
Received a lot of compliments for hiking shoes.
Very comfortable right out of the box.
Very cushiony insoles Feels like I'm wearing house shoes.
10000000% recommend.
So comfy!
I bought a pair in 2019 and am now ordering a second pair.
The stitching has held up beautifully and while not waterproof if I fully submerge my foot, Ive done enough sloshing through wet areas to know that my feet will stay dry as long as I dont get the tongue area soaked.Heres hoping the manufacturer has keep the same standards these last few years.
Broke these in on a muddy, melty hike and my feet stayed dry and warm and the boots were comfortable the whole day.
Great boots, especially for the cost.
Really lightweight, waterproof, hiking boot, very comfortable, my wife is very happy and satisfied.
Keeps the foot dry during heavy rain, this is very important.
I really am happy with these boots.
I have a very hard time finding comfortable hiking boots but, these are 5 stars!
So happy with this purchase: the boots are super comfortable, lightweight, warm and waterproof- tried and tested by long walks and a cold and rainy Scotch weather.
Highly recommended.
Id recommend to order 1 size larger than your current size
Highly recommended.
Very good winter hiking boot
Well Ive been trying to upload a picture for the past 10 minutes so I can show yall how amazing these boots really are with my hiking adventures but Amazon doesnt want to let me upload a photo so onto the review.
Im a pretty avid hiker and so Ive been looking for a really good sturdy pair of boots to hiking and I came across these because first of all they have really good reviews and second of all the color combo of red and black was my favorite so I went ahead and bought them and recently went to Pedernales Falls State Park in Austin Texas and WOWZA!!
We even kept bringing it up how amazing it was they dried SOOOOOOOOO fast!
I highly recommend these boots!!!
I love these boots.
I've been wearing them at least twice a day, everyday since I got them.I take the dog for long ocean side walks, going in and out of tide pools, creeks, puddles, and mucky mud, and these boot have been perfect.
They're probably not up to the demands of more technical mountaineering, but for day hikes they are great.I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting a comfortable, waterproof daily walking/hiking boot.
The toe box and the width is a bit narrow, my feet are regular but i would be more comfortable if i got a wide.
They look so durable and im sure these will last me years!
Next year I will be looking for a better and warmer walking boot.
These are nice otherwise.
I will always love these boots.
Waterproof, comfortable and alway fit!
They fit perfectly, true to size, and extremely comfortable for all day wear.
Highly recommended.
This boot is so cozy and definitely cute.
My favorite everyday look cute boot.
These are best hiking boots I have ever worn.
The reviews on these r very mixed some ppl love them and others dont, but seems like its the same with with every other boot as well, so I chose these cuz awesome price and they dont  look not so hideously ugly.
I usally wear 6 - 6 1/2 so I bought the 6 1/2 in these and they fit perfect.
I dont think I have anything to worry about on the dirt trail these boots are super comforting and supportive on my feet, I love them and the price on Amazon is great ? im thinking I will buy another pair in a diffrent color.
It is warm, comfortable and well supported.
Like the boots fit perfectly,  very satisfied, thankyou
They fit perfect, true to size and super comfy.
Read tons of great reviews and the shoes definitely exceeded my expectations they are the best shoes Ive ever owned, I cant wait to start hiking again.
I love these boots.
I walked through a river of water and my feet didn't get wet, until the water went over my ankles.
Thanks to amazon, it was such a bargain for a quality product.
Although it is rigid, it is also very comfy.
No padding for support or comfort inside.
These Columbia Newton Ridge boots were purchased for my daughterBoots are well made, have decent traction qualities, and are durable.
I work in a factory that uses powder as part of the manufacturing process.
I had a pair of these in red from a few years ago and started wearing them to work and they were perfect.
Break in period is about a week but then its so perfect.
I loved these so much I used the try and buy feature to buy them in two different colors.
Good quality
I purchased these hiking boots after reading several reviews and within days of a lot of hiking in Alaska.
They arrived quickly and fit nearly perfect.
Ill add that I bought 2 pair, one for myself and daughter.
For anyone who is familiar with the trail, knows that its pretty easy & well maintained until you decide to climb the boulder field.
To keep it short, I got on a call with a family member in distress and I needed to keep them on the phone.
The grip is amazing and they fit so comfortably but are sturdy.
I love these boots and I hope they continue to make them.
If you are able to purchase these, Id say that they are winner.
Happy hiking!
This shoes works very well on winter.
They have a very good grip and isnt easy to slide.
Im 8.5 size and I ordered a size 9, and feels so good.
I bought these on an incredible promotion over the holidays and love them!I have 2 dogs that require a lot of walking, and I find that my walks are best when over a variety of terrain.
The Columbia Newton Plus boots fit my need for a light hiking boot that will keep my feet dry and comfortable.Initially, I was skeptical.
I experienced the same kind of pressure on my big toe as others here have mentioned.
I love the support.
The sole feels good on harder surfaces and yes, so far it seems waterproof.
I am very happy, and I hope that I can get at least 2 good seasons out of these before I walk through the tread.I would strongly recommend these to people, but be aware that they do run closer to the large side of true to size, so take that into consideration.
These are fairly warm, and if you wear them in the summer in hotter areas, your feet will definitely sweat a lot.Anyway, these were a great value and I like the overall boots.
Here it is, two years later and I am still happy with my purchase.
The tread is totally shot and the boot is no longer waterproof, but they did last 2 years.
So far the grip on wet, mossy granite has been excellent.
Highly recommend.
Wore on vacation and now for work (construction sites, wooded lots, etc.)  I love these.
They are my new favorite work boot.
My job requires a lot of steep climbing on hillsides and working on rooftops (some with steep pitch), I will buy again when these wear out.
It worked well for me).
Better yet-my toes weren't killing me by the end of it.
We did not come across any lakes so I can't speak to the waterproof-ness of these shoes.Bottom line: Yes, I recommend these hiking boots for your next hiking adventure!
Great fit, no break in period, excellent value.
I will do an update in down the track as to water resistance and shoe longevity.
I wore them throughout the winter walking my dog a few miles a day through snow, ice, mud, and rain, and they kept my feet dry and warm.
These are very comfortable and have just the right amount of support for my very troublesome falling arches and hypermobile ankles.
They fit true to size and stay securely in place, not rubbing on my ankles too much.
However, nice high boot socks are absolutely necessary, since the material that touches your ankles on these shoes is kind of rough and will definitely rub you raw if you don't protect your skin, so just keep that in mind.
I love the way they look with a pair of jeans or my sweats.
They give a really good active look to any casual or outdoorsy outfit.
Will definitely buy another pair to rotate between so I can keep them from wearing out on me.
I've put several miles on them and they've done very well.
These boots were a really fair price for the quality, arrived quickly and feel absolutely amazing!
Highly recommend these for avid wide feet hikers!
Totally recommend
Price was good, got them on sale
I wanted something multi-purpose that I could also hike in, and while I have yet to go on an intense, inclined hike, these for sure do well for long walks through snow, ice, mud, and gravel alike.The best call I made was wearing these for a day around my office just to get a feel for them and break them in.
I am still very happy with these boots!
Also, wearing wool-blend socks helped a lot because they're thicker.
I was so happy I had stuck with them.
I have these boots in black/poppy red and they're my favorite shoes.
They're easy to break in and very comfortable once they are broken in.
I bought a second pair in elk tan/teal so I can always have a backup pair in my car.
They also had faint creases at the toe box indicating someone wore them a decent amount.
I ordered new for full price.
I exchanged for a size 9 and luckily they were brand new this time and fit much better.
Amazon made it right.
I have recommended them to everyone I know who has even a semi-active lifestyle.
I bought these in my true size despite some reviews saying to buy a size up--but these fit perfectly so it worked out great.
I haven't submerged them to test out the waterproof claim, but it rains a lot where I live and my feet are never wet after trudging through rain puddles.Very happy with the purchase and I highly recommend these shoes
They are true to size (AKA Don't go up half a size), and fit fine even when I put my prescription orthotics in them.
They are a bit stiff when I first put them on, then once they warm up they are pliable and very comfortable.
Even though I really wanted to like this boot I found that it just didnt fit correctly.
The boots appeared comfortable, waterproof, and rugged.
These shoes are amazing, durable, definitely waterproof, hiked so many times on extremely rough terrains and it did its job.
Great grip, better than expected on slippery ice.
And you need thick socks for these if you have relatively sensitive skin, I got hives after using it the first couple of times ( not shoe cuts, but hives for the material)Overall a really good shoe.
Comfortable sole, long lasting.
Definitely several hundred miles in these.
Its kinda worn out and gotten dirty, but the grip is still amazing, still water proof.
Very stable and havent hurt my ankle even once.
Definitely the best pair Ive gotten
So comfortable, durable, well made.
I love these boots!
Ped un color, luego el producto en pedidos cambi a otro, marrn, y finalmente me lleg negro......
For this trip It held up well to a good amount of abusive terrain.
Super lightweight and comfortable.
Well-made boot, I sprayed water repellant on for wet days and snow when needed.
Well worth the purchase, my first pair lasted for two years (actually there still in good shape).
I bought these since my hiking sneakers were trashed.I originally ordered a womens 10US and 10.5US through Amazon Prime wardrobe because reviews were conflicting about sizing up or true to size.
So Id recommend true to size!!
They did well in Hawaii mud and dirt, but I did slip at one point on a wet rock and I felt perhaps the soles shouldve gripped a bit better.
But they do the job well for the fair price point, and are stylishly designed.
perfect for hiking, keep your feet dry and warm
The Columbia Newton Ridge Plus are a very good quality fall/winter hiking boots that performs well on trails, but can look great also in casual looks.I love to hike and I need good quality boots to keep my feet warm and safe.
Leather shoes usually need some time to break them in, but these were very comfortable from the beginning.
It's quite a nice styling piece with jeans or leggings (although I wear them with casual skirts/dresses as well).
if you have even slightly wide fit I would recommend a wider size, since the construction of the boots doesn't allow flexibility.March 2018 update (after December 2016 purchase): The leather shows after one year some wear, but otherwise the hiking boots lasted very well in time (the sole shows minimal signs of wear).
They fit so comfortably and provided me with so much ankle support I didnt appreciate until today.
I really recommend for so many reasons & theyre cute too!When it came down to it I didnt know what to size to get so I just ordered what I normally wear in gym shoes which is 8.
I have narrow feetThey fit really good.
So dont be afraid to order your exact size but if you like extra space in your shoe size up a half.I hope this helps!
These boots are incredible, very comfortable and fully waterproof.
They felt sturdy and have good grip.
I have recommended them to my friends.
I found what I was looking for, but these are so comfortable I decided to keep them.
I bought it to my son, he is very pleased with it
Very comfortable.
The other's were two of these Columbia's, where I went with the website description for sizes and have now returned two.
The other four stars are a mark for quality, which Columbia aspires to have, price, and as a humongous and much needed thank you for your free returns on many items found under the Prime name.
These Columbia Newton Ridge Plus held true.
Kept my feet warm and dry.
I highly recommend them!
purely a personal note, I was not happy with fit and toe design.
But overall they are decent shoes for what I use them for.
They are absolutely perfect.
Highly recommended.
I am truly satisfied with my purchase.
It was comfortable, true size, light weighted, and I had no foot blister at the end of the day.
I have worn these a few times hiking and they are wonderful.
Must wear over the ankle socks or the tongue rubs but these are perfect otherwise.
Let me start out with: THESE ARE AMAZING BOOTS and YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THESE BOOTS.
These boots held up against all different types of climates and weather and water on my road trip and they still look great!
We went through water, dessert, rain, and mud, and these boots held it fine.
The size fits as expected if you go a half size up, and walking through the river, it kept my feet nice and dry.
They've also got amazing grip.
Whether we were on wet stones, or gravelly and sand covered rocks that could easily give way and make you slip or fall they worked amazingly.
By far the best boots ever.
Extremely comfortable and has a wider toe box, which I like.
It's definitely worth the cost.
A little heavier than I'm used to but so durable that they made it home and I'm still wearing them.
Love these!
Theyre very niceheavy in a good way.
The color is as expected and they fit very well.
But so far, so good!
My sister is a Columbia shopper and I showed them to her and she was quite surprised.
I will let you know after the hike how they performed.
I am hoping the "energy return"  part will come through......ok I am back to complete the review after the hike....I have to say I give these 5 stars now...they came through with exactly what they say they do-very comfortable, a good size toe box and very lightweight.
These boots win my vote!
I def recommend-oh and they stayed tied the whole way!
I love these boots so much that I finally bought a second pair.
Wore these on a hike and couldnt even feel the rocks and twigs underfoot.
They are so very warm.
I know these will keep my feet warm and dry on any trail.
I paired them with a pair of carhart thermal socks and I couldnt recommend a shoe more!
They have lasted really well and are my go to winter hiking boot!
I purchased these boots to hike the highest peak in the Caribbean: 3090m.
They held through light rain and big messy puddles of mud.Sturdy: I sprained my left ankle a couple years back so the height of the boot was perfect to protect my ankles from bending when stepping on irregular trails.Warm: Super warm!
I ordered these boots because they looked similar to ones Ive had for many years and was pleasantly surprised that they were exactly the same.
I love them!
I finally decided on this Columbia boot, and ordered it through Amazon because it was a good price and the color I wanted.
This boot was perfect!
I wore it on the plane and then hiked Maui... it survived the sharp rocks of the lava fields and mud and slippery rocks of the waterfalls.
It was truly waterproof in the rainforest and had good grip and ankle support.
They're comfortable right out of the box, have good traction, and are waterproof.
I live in Michigan and walk a couple miles for exercise every day, so in the winter I need good boots.
Just before winter each year I treat the boots with one or two separate coats of silicone spray, and that's it.
I buy a half size larger than my shoe size and that's perfect for Smartwool socks.
I'm delighted!
So I needed  to return them, but  I  ordered a size  smaller, 11, (my usual size) and they perform wonderfully well.
The fit is so much better!
I love everything about the shoes.
TheyAre comfortable, light & they fit Perfect.
Been wearing them for about an hour now they feel wonderful.
I wanted to get these boots for hiking!Absolutely love them, very comfortable, and look beautiful.
I love these boots!
I ordered a half size up to accommodate heavy socks and insoles.
They fit & look great.
Comfortable fit & great support at ankle & sole for hiking.
I bought Columbia Women's Newton Ridge Plus Waterproof Hiking Boot, size 10.5I have trouble finding a good fit in boots as one of my feet is size 10.5 and the other is size 10.
The high-traction grip on the sole works well in rocky and sandy desert terrain.
I'm happy to say my feet don't ache after wearing these.One reason I selected these is I was determined to pay under $100 as I'm not doing hard-core cross-country backpacking here, just long desert day-hikes with occasional surprise thunderstorms.
And for the price I am satisfied with these boots.
The quality seems very good, probably better than all the other shoes I own.
It's worth it.
Great shoes to wear walking all day at work.
I typically wear a 9.5 but ordered a 10 in these and the fit is perfect.
Overall Im happy with these boots and would recommend.
they are so comfortable and really water proof love them
These boots have successfully seen me through several miles in the Grand Canyon, Big Bend, and Guadalupe.
I purchased these in July for the Grand Canyon, and despite other reviews warning to break them in first, they went right to work.
They seem well-made and look nice.
They are light weight and kept my feet dry and warm as we went in the cooler time of year.
I was anticipating a handful of blisters by making the bold move of wearing them for the first time on a 15 miler but I escaped blister free.
I usually wear an 8.5 shoe but I order a half size bigger for my hiking shoes and they fit me true to size.
I noticed in my winter boots, the first pair fit well, and the second was tighter.
True water proof and comfortable.
So far so good, they performed just as well as the old pair, handled mud and water with ease with no ankle rubbing and a minimal amount of rubbing on my pinky toe.
The toe box feels great with only 1 pair of socks and will hopefully feel the same this winter with 2 pairs of socks.
So far I'm very pleased with my purchase and I'm looking forward to hiking in them this Fall.
Hiked for 6 straight days in the Rocky  Mountains and very happy with lightness, yet protection boots provided.
Loved the look and comfort of this hiking boot.
I bought these for our trip to Alaska and they were awesome on hikes and in the mud and rain.
I walk all day at work, been wearing these for over 2 years and they are still comfortable, I just bought another pair because they went on sale and I have a back up if these ever fall apart, which I do not see happening anytime soon.
This hiking shoes were perfect.
Product was attractive.
Im very happy with my purchase .
They fit wonderfully, are comfortable, and definitely kept my feet warm and dry!HOWEVER!It has only been 5 months since I bought them and the glue along the side of the right boot where the fabric meets the rubber has let go, which lets in water.
This is a very durable and light weight hiking boot.
I'd recommend using a water proof repellant on them.
They were very comfortable for my first time wearing them.
Love these!
I ordered a half size bigger and the fit perfect.
Other than that shoes seem to be great.
These hiking boots were very comfortable from the first time I wore them.
I felt they protected my feet and ankles well and they had good traction while I was on a variety of hiking trails.
Highly recommend these boots.
Very nice hiking boot.
Fits well according to size chart.
Will add a foot pad for added comfort.
Looks very nice with jeans.
Other than that...it's a dang good boot!
These are my second pair of these boots and I love them.
The first pair I wore right out of the box 16 miles round trip up Mt. LeConte and the second pair I wore right out of the box 23 miles on the Sheltowee.
If youre a more experienced hiker, these will last quite a while and are priced well to replace.They are water resistant but dont let water get over the top.They are not great summer boots if its really hot and humid because they dont breathe as well as others - but theyre amazing winter boots.
The color scheme and look is so cute.
They worked out amazing for my desert hike.
I recommend them for new and experienced hikers.
As que los busqu por este medio con el mismo modelo, caractersticas, marca, etc..
As que me pregunto si stos sern originales?.
These work way better in the dewy morning grass than my old sneakers did.
These boots are absolutely amazing!!
Worth every penny and I can't recommend them enough!!
They fit a bit large for me but if you put on a thick hiking sock or get an insole, they fit perfectly.
They are super light and sooo comfortable, I didn't get a single blister while wearing them.
They're good to drive in as well.I got them for a last minute trip and wore them first on a day of about 6km of hiking (hills, forests, mud, etc.) and they were perfect.
Wore them the next day for an 18km uphill climb in the mountains and returned with no blisters, no pain, 0 slips or falls, 100% dry feet.
They are absolutely waterproof as well!
They were probably one of my best purchases and I can only highly recommend them to others!
Excellent!!
These boots are amazing!
Love them!
Even with thick socks they're comfortable and easy to clean.
My first pair of hiking boots and I'm very pleased!
I'm a man, but will often buy women's shoes, due to my narrow size 8 feet.
First the size... other's have recommended going a half size up, and I agree.
Usually the conversion from men's to women's is to add one and a half.
I went with a 10 and they fit perfectly.
I also appreciate the quick lace hooks so getting in and out is easy.
Nice boots!
Comfortable but sturdy and feel great.
I walk miles a day and will really enjoy these boots
Overall this is a decent.
sturdy, waterproof shoe for a reasonable price.I needed a waterproof boot/shoe at a very reasonable price for the winter weather in upstate N.Y. (rain, mud, snow).
These stay pretty warm in the winter and have plenty of room for a thick sock.
I usually have trouble finding comfortable shoes due to my low arches and these feel great!
Really comfortable and supportive.
The fit is excellent- wide enough at the ball of the foot and narrow enough in the heel to hold tight.
A great hiker all in all.
well made
Love them.
These are great!
It will be perfect with warm socks in the winter.As others said, they are not as soft inside as other hiking boots.
The sole is pretty flexible thought.
They dont look chonky and manly like other hiking boots.
Awesome color !
Boots are definitely quality made.
I love the natural brown tones that pair with anything I wear.
Great shoe - I get a lot of compliments on them.
I loved my last pair so much, I bought the exact same shoe again!!
They even look nice enough with my work jeans and button-up shirts untucked to where I wear them to work every single day, and I work in upper-class retail - ha!
I highly recommend these shoes!
The boots are very comfortable with a short break-in period.
I did and they were too big (I could feel the crease on my toe like the other reviewers said) so I sent them back and ordered my real size and they are a perfect fit!
I just moved to TN and we went for a hike two days this past week and they were incredibly sturdy, comfortable, and light weight!
These boots fit great, however after the first use, the grommet holding the laces on the top fell out.
Overall I'm very pleased with these and look forward to many more hikes with them!
I bought these to take to the Grand Canyon with me in January and they work great!
I like that the shoes come up high enough to give me ankle support.The grip on the shoes was pretty decent.
But, if you carefully navigate the ice patches with these shoes on, it gave a decent amount of grip for me to trek across.
They are stylish and comfy.
Love them!
They resisted the water and were warm enough when walking in the snow.
I highly recommend them.
I find they are a great value.
great value!
Havent had them long, but they seem like a very nice boot.
I wore these my whole trip to Peru in July.
these shoes were an amazing investment for my first set of hiking boots, I will wear them from now on when I go out on trails!
Many reviews mention the bend across the toe and it is true that the boot creases at your big toe but i didnt find this to be an issue for me.
They were absolutely great and I'm happy with the purchase.
Great hiking ? boots, I walk for miles and I feel super comfortableEstas botas son bien confortables para ir a hiking se las recomiendo.
I purchased these pretty last minute for our honeymoon in Oregon and I was not disappointed.I wore these EVERYWHERE on our trip.
Also, as a photographer myself I really needed something that was comfortable and highly water resistant.
I took these hiking up mountains, through a shallow river, and walked along a few wet beaches and had no water in shoes.I usually wear a womens size 10 but ordered a 10.5 just to be safe.
I live in Colorado, I love to hike so I bought these and have been wearing them quite a bit for the last several months.
I have several pairs of hiking shoes and this is my favorite pair.
Thinner socks caused a blister on the top of my toe the first hike.
They have a great grip, are waterproof, snow proof and comfortable for hours.
I highly recommend.
I bought these for work based on the positive reviews.
Very comfy so far, right out of the box.
Thank you to whomever for a good product.
Really look nice too, for hiking boots.
I do a lot of walking outside  in the winter.
I was excited that they required no break in period at all.
I spend roughly 6 hours of my day walking dogs in the woods, along a trail by our facility.
For $50, these have been a great purchase and I can see them lasting for seasons to come.
Ladies, if youre looking for the perfect hiking boot, look no further!
Sono a pianta estremamente stretta (il modello wide in Italia costa uno sproposito), ma sono pi lunghe del normale.Le sconsiglio per il trekking, ma sono ottime scarpe invernali da citt visto che puntano tutto sull'estetica e molto poco su confort e tecnica.
I was hesitant to buy these because I already had some Merrell low top hiking sneakers that I love...but I was heading out on a snowshoe trip and needed something waterproof and high around the ankles.
Plus, they have a nice clean, sleek look to them.
For as "heavy duty" as they feel, I think the design is pretty solid.
I got a lot of compliments on them actually!
For the price, I think they are definitely have great value, especially if you like to get outdoors and take on some more challenging hikes but aren't super hardcore about it.
I decided to take a shot and trust Columbia.
its the best of both worlds.
The next morning when I put them on they felt great.
the grey color helped hide dirt.
Very Comfortable!!!!!!
When I first wore them on a hike I got a blister behind my right ankle.
The shoes are lightweight and fit perfectly.
I would recommend these hiking boots based on my experience.
The first pair lasted 2 years.
Lasted a full four years before the seam separated.
I went half size bigger and it was a great choice.
Amaze by the quality and the price to be honest.
They only had size 8 and they were on the snug side, so I thought I would be fine ordering a 8.5 (which is almost twenty bucks cheaper).
Great deal.Update 11/11/14: so I went on some short hikes with these but chose to take my lighter, more comfortable running shoes on longer hikes.
I love these boots!!
But since Amazon has free returns on these, I gave them a try.I normally would wear 8.5 wide, but tried the size 9.
When first put them on, I felt the toe box hit my big toe right on the nail/cuticle.
I have been wearing them all day long since.They are incredibly comfortable!!
Great hiking boot, very comfortable and easy to wear for all day hikes, walks in any weather.
Love it when a brand is reliable and consistent that you can order one of their products online and you know it will fit and be a good quality.
Las empec a usar para el trabajo para probarlas y son cmodas y ligeras la talla la siento bien aunq se siente ligeramente flojas lo que es bueno ya que para cumbre se necesita calcetas ms gruesas y quedarn perfecto, ha estado lloviendo y no eh tenido problemas con el agua, solo en piso de azulejo mojado resbala un poco pero se entiende por el tipo de suela.
Very comfortable, ordered my normal size, fits great.
This is my second pair, they definitely keep feet warm and dry.
I'm a true women's size 8.
Ascending in my hike was a breeze, the traction on these boots is great, I could climb up steep dirt grades no problem.
My pinky toe and heel developed a blister.
In my work I walk the whole shift, these boots fit me well in size, they are super comfortable and light, the best I have bought.
I recommend this product to 100%.
These are great for flatter surfaces.
Tight toes  caused me to get a Subungual hematomafrom the pressure when going down really steep slopes when up in the mountains.
For the women that have big feet - these fit like a charm!
But these shoes are perfectly proportioned, and fit quite well, with enough room to wear a thick sock if needed.
Overall, this is a good looking boot!Also - I have yet to go hiking in these and will update when I do so!
Love the boot it's self, keeps feet dry, good for hiking.
The color is a pretty neutral gray.
The shoestrings are a good length.
These are great boots.
But so far i love them!
I like the look of boots for work, and these are comfortable enough for me to be on my feet all day long.
So I got the exact same pair in black, but in hindsight, I should have gotten a half size smaller.
I am a solid 7.5 in most shoes, sometimes an 8, but these feel a bit big in my regular 7.5.
I like this boot because its comfortable, has a nice toe box, and just right for mild hiking.
Worked well.
Normally, I wear a size 8 but ordered a 9 for extra length and thicker hiking socks.
I did a good bit of research looking for boots that would be practical for all conditions - dry or wet.
First off, they fit like a dream!
I'm going to be wearing these to the snow this week and will see how they hold up - so far, I am totally satisfied!
Fashionable , durable & nice fit.
It was a great fit even with thick wool socks and didnt feel tight.
There is zero break in period and even walking a ton these remain so comfortable.
Super cute with a pair of leggings as well- Ive gotten a lot of compliments on them.
I love the cushioning around the ankle, I think it may have saved me a few times.
I would definitely recommend these, in fact, I'm trying to get my husband to buy the men's version ??
I was having problems with damage to my longest toenails, when hiking, so I purchased 2 sizes bigger.
I have to tie them pretty tight, not to be loose, but really like them.
Definitely would buy them again.I feel like I have plenty of room for my toes, the width is slightly too big, but I did get two sizes bigger for hiking, seems to support my foot well.They take a little breaking in, but then are good to go!
I love these boots.
The first day I wore them I took them on what was supposed to be a short day hike but we suddenly got ambitious and wound up hiking around 13 miles.
mile hiking trips with me and have held up well.
I also wore them as snow boots over the course of a couple days this winter and they did fine in the snow too.
I love them though and fully recommend them- plus you can't beat the price.
Bought them for the summer camp I worked at and they helped so much!
Ultimately, I decided to go with these because of the good reviews and price.
I ordered a half size up as others had recommended which worked out great.
The shoes fit just right with thick socks!
The shoes were so comfortable and my feet stayed warm and dry the whole time.
Im very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to buy these if youre looking for a good pair of hiking boots on a budget!
Pros: They are well made and fit my feet in my regular size.
Love how light weight this boots are.
Size 8.5 fit perfect with regular hiking socks on.
Have enough toes room.Pleasantly surprised after couple days of moderate hiking/climbing/walking in yosemite.
Padded ankles to provide comfort and stability.
Highly recommend!!
Im very happy with these, Im planning a trip in a few months to Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion and though Im not a heavy hiker, I wanted good footwear for the trails etc that I will be doing.
Me enamor del modelo de las botas desde la imagen, fsicamente me encantaron y me quedaron perfectas.
the first day my boyfriend took me on a muddy atv ride and they definitely held up!
I almost got a 10.5 based of reviews but ended up with the 10 and its the perfect fit even with bulky wool socks.There was an uncomfortable crease only on my right shoe but i wore them all through out the trip and endured a 7mile hike and it eventually worked itself out.Theyre comfortable and good for the price!
Hard toe which is perfect because im a little clumsy and clonk my feet on rocks all the time.
Seriously happy purchase .
The fit was perfect.
I recommend them for the winter and cooler seasons, they keep your feet cozy warm.
I love these boots.
Extremely comfortable, they are sturdy around ankles providing great support.
Would highly recommend.
Wanted to give this boot 5 stars because they are a great all weather reliable boot but there is one tiny flaw that can be easily remedied by anyone once aware.
Buy a good set of laces you can tie once and not have to keep stopping, remove your pack and tie your boots.
The boots fit well on day one and with the proper wool socks very comfortable and I was blister free on my first thru hike albeit I do have tough feet developed over 40 years of walking and hiking.
I highly recommend them for the practical hiker who needs a good deal on a good hiking shoe-boot.
Feels sturdy, havent been able to use them on a hike yet but Im sure they will be perfect!
Also very flexible.
Love these, fit perfect and are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
---I wear these boots daily at work where I do a lot of light walking outside.
I wanted a lightweight, comfortable boot with decent grip and ankle support.
I have two new boots and I'm happy with it
So comfortable!
They arrived quickly and fit perfectly right out of the box.
I hiked about 5 miles in steep, rugged terrain and was very pleased with their performance.
I'm very pleased with these and highly recommend them!
They are very light and the fact that they have been through it but still look new lets me know that the quality on these are amazing.
They are comfortable once you break them in but until then your feet will hurtI wish there was a cushion at the top so they dont rub on your leg
They fit well but in the toe area, they are slightly tight.
I hope with wear they'll loosen and be more comfortable.
I bought these shoes right before a camping trip with my family.
We did a moderate hike every day and these shoes saved my life.
I am so glad I returned a cheaper pair I bought from a local store.
These Columbia are absolutely worth it.
Really nice boots, excellent fit size 3, eu 36.
Would defo recommend.
Best boots ever
I needed hiking boots right away for a trip to a ranch.
The true waterproof design!
Great purchase for the price!
Fit perfect, look better in person.
They were mostly good, but there was a bit of rubbing despite them fitting well.
They held up GREAT in water and mud - there was a lot of that hiking in the redwoods in rainy season!
Not a drop of water made it anywhere near my feet.
Easy to clean and held up great so far.
I am totally loving mi shoes so far.
They fit perfectly well for my exact size, they are comfortable and I can go really on a very steep slope and I don't slide or slip.
What a great boot!
Most boots I found looked very masculine (not that I'm a girly girl) but these were a perfect medium.
Highly recommend.
Super comfy right off the bat.
Then we did a 7 mile hike the next day and these were phenomenal.
We crossed tons of steep climbs, dust, water, and slick rocks.
Would recommend these boots to anyone - SO comfy and made my first hiking trip one to remember!
I got these boots as a birthday gift for our trip to Colorado.
Really well made, seemed like they would be durable and really comfortable, and they came quickly.
Sorry Columbia (I typically love their products!)
Lightweight and comfortable.
These shoes are awesome!
Very comfortable.
The quality seems fine, the style is nice.
I absolutely loved how they felt when I put them on with thicker hiking type of socks.
It felt just right, Im glad I stuck true to my size.
At first I thought it may have been too big and then with the socks it was perfect.
I loved the top 4 clip around a for the shoe laces so I could make them more snug.
I hiked for my first time 4 days in a row and climbed multiple rocks and didnt get one single blister!
I also used anti blister cream in addition to these amazing shoes.
Love them!!
We made it to the top and these boots helped with climbing.
I cant wait to continue to use them with our new love of hiking.
These boots are good looking and they fit well.
A nice touch is that when the lace is tied it actually does not loosen.
The boot does very well in the snow and slush and are warm with one pair of socks.
I have always loved Columbia boots and these boots do not disappoint.
I Highly recommend them.
I wear a 6.5 so thats what I ordered and as some of the reviews mentioned, they did run a tad bit big.
Not much though, its just enough room to be able to wear some thick socks for warmth so for me thats actually perfect.
I wore them around my house on the day they arrived and they felt comfortable with no issues.
All in all, theyre cute boots and a great value for the money.
Good boot for a good price.
I havent taken them on the trails yet, but so far so good.
I ordered a 6 and overall am happy with them, but I do find that I need a thick pair of socks to have them fit more comfortably.
I wouldnt order a half size up just to fit another layer of socks for warmth.
So I'm a size 8, ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly, I even have some room at the toes and to put thicker socks.I NEVER review any of the million items that I buy on Amazon but I just had to write one for these babies.
I walk a ton for work, Im on my feet moving all day.
I needed a shoe that was comfortable and waterproof and can last for a long time.
This is the greatest!!
I actually look forward to walking around all day delivering mail now that I know I wont be coming home with feet that look like theyve been in a boxing match with Mike Tyson!
This shoes are very comfortable they run true to your size , I issued for hiking like 7 miles I didnt get tired at all and Im 46 years old ? but I love walking to , still they worth the money , they look a little cheap but still I regret not taking them to a previous hiking ?.
I bought my regular size 7.5 and these for great even with thicker wool socks.
They are good walking boots for the price.
Very light weighted and reasonable waterproof.
For regular hikes in muddy conditions they are perfect.
I was really nervous about wearing them for the first time for that long of a hike but my feet honestly felt great.
So so far these are much better and super cute!!!
Der Schuh sieht super aus und macht auch qualitativ einen guten Eindruck.
These are by far the best!!
Keeps my feet dry and warm all day!
Distributor is awesome too!
Got these for a week long trip to Colorado, they were perfect.
Fit well, comfortable for all the different hikes we went on.
My best friend and I unknowingly ordered the same pair!
Both of us loved them.
I walk in wet grass that is a bit higher.
If the grass wasnt so thick and high I think these would be much better but overall pleased with them .
But overall pleased with them
Super pleased with these boots.
Wore them for five days straight in dust, on rock, in soil, in small creeks across the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Zion, including a few strenuous trails, and they performed amazingly with good traction the whole time.
Love these hiking shoes.
I pulled these out of the box, put them on and wow, what a difference.
I did put my own inserts into them, I do that with all the shoes I wear, but other than that, they were great right out of the box.
Highly recommend.
I bought these for my granddaughter, a freshman college student to keep her feet warm around campus.
She picked these out because of their good reviews, brand name and that she will be able to wear them hiking this summer.
I hear from her mom that she keeps mentioning how much she likes them and how comfortable they are.
I tried them on with the wool socks I use for my hikes and it was the perfect fit.
I learned it the hard way and went to buy $150dls Vasque boots from REI, worth every penny!!
I absolutely love these.
They are my first hiking boots and fit right out of the box.
Overall very comfy and good traction hiking various terrain!
I recently bought these shoes for my wife as she's an avid hiker.
She took them out for a hike on the weekend and she quite enjoyed it.
For the price, it was worth it in our opinion.
I love the color and outer design of these boots!
I ordered a size 10 (half size bigger) but it fit me just right (no room to wiggle my toes).
i just started going hiking so i wanted something comfortable and sturdy and these are perfect!!
Fit very comfortable, no blisters.
Love these boots.
The toe box is ample, they support my ankle, and theyreholy crapwaterproof enough to wade a stream.
Id definitely buy them again.
The fit was a bit bigger than I would like it to be.
As most reviewers have stated, if you get a size that is a bit bigger, it does seem to create a crease and feels a bit uncomfortable because of the rubnign presssure on the skin (but thick socks helps a lot!)
These are absolutely perfect!
Durable, comfortable and very anti-slip!
They held up great and never hurt, even on the first day.
After reading reviews I was a bit worried that they might hurt, but they have been completely fine.
That is especially good since I'll be wearing heavy socks.
I saw a review from someone who bought them for a trip to Iceland which includes lots of walking on ice and pebbles and she found them to be perfect.
They are fantastically waterproof and hold up well in the snow.
I do recommend warm socks because I find they dont hold warmth well.
10/10 the size five fits exactly as I need it too, would recommend to anyone
I love the look and color of these hiking boots - they are comfortable.I do not hike in them - I do not hike.
My H is giving them to me as a gift, so I look forward to really trying them out in a few weeks.
Both trails were muddy and wet, and the boots performed wonderfully!
I was able to use them on the hikes though with no problems.
I think these are great boots.
Still perfect.
Offers great support.
Still breaking these in, but so far, they're good!
I assume that will get better as they break in.
I needed waterproof boots that weren't my Sorels, must as I love them.
Bravo!
The traction was great for both hikes.
There was some snow at Bryce, and they had great water resistance.
Really good ankle support for tricky places that could be dangerous/possible ankle roll spots.
Overall, very much enjoyed my experience with them and have used them for hikes around San Diego as well.
I have extremely high arches and have been wearing orthotics for over 25 years.
So far so good.
I bought these shoes to volunteer at a zoo and they have been wonderful.
I do a lot of hosing and trudging through tall dewey grass and my feet have never been wet.
Overall an awesome shoe.
I have neuropathy in my feet and this boot was comfortable from the first time I put it on!!
Fit great and have amazing grip.
I bought some insoles and now the fit really well.
Very comfortable, provides great support when I am on my feet most of the day.
Waterproofing holds up well.
These have done well!
I also like the solid brown boots because I won't be disappointed when I get them dirty, and I plan to get them dirty.
I took a picture because I have really put these boots through the rounds.Additionally, we managed to get caught in a drenching rain.
The boots held up and feet stayed dry.The size as everyone has noted runs small.
I am completely satisfied with the purchase and hope to still order a second pair.
Absolutely love these boots, they are very light weight.
I bought the grey ones and the colour is very nice.
Columbia made another good product!
Definitely worth the price!
This ia a warm, waterproof boot.
Wore these hiking once so far and they are really nice to keep your feet warm and dry!
They are also very comfortable and fit true to size.
My boots arrived today and they are absolutely awesome!I was in need of a durable, medium to light weight comfortable boot for motorcycle riding... I think I nailed it!
I took a gamble because my feet are flat and wide but the 11 fits perfectly with thinner socks.
For the price and quality, this year round bit is hard to beat.
Theyre lighter than most of the other boots in the women's hiking category, but they still offer all of the essential features youll need, including ample toe and heel protection, a gusseted tongue, a wide toe box, and a well-thought-out lacing system.
The design is also breathable and waterproof.PROS:1.
High quality design3.
Ill comment after Ive worn them several times.So far I love them !
I ordered a size 8 which is what I usually wear and they fit perfect.
The soles are great and no slipping on rocks, even now with the threads running so low.
True to size and good support on the arch as well as the ankles.
This is my second pair and I hope to get another 4 years out of them.
I have another brand and these are far more superior.
Well worth the money.
Love these hiking boots!
The reviews looked good, and I had a few weeks to wear them in before my trip, so I decided to go for it.
I followed the tips to order up half a size and they were perfect.
I wore them for hours on end - through rain and snow, uphill and down, paved paths and rugged rock.
I would recommend these to everyone.
Plus they look very retro and cute, the color goes with everything.
I wore thick wool socks with these boots and they still fit perfectly considering I don't have the thinnest feet.
I got the size I usually get in shoes and was very nervous about them fitting too tight, but they were great!
The material of the boots is exceptional and I see them lasting for a long while.
Excellent.
I have five pairs of these awesome hiking boots , three in the nylon and two in leather and I love them
This would be a very nice boot if it wasnt for the weird crease bothering my toes.
Its a light, well made boot however the toe box is too high and wide.
It creates a crease that comes right on your toes when you step.
Love these boots.
Really comfortable and did great on our hike.
The sizing is right on.
I wore thick socks and they were still perfect.
The only downside is that they don't have the best grips on the bottom but they are good enough.
Very comfortable, I'm glad I went with these for my hiking boots.
Very happy with this purchase.
They are great.
We're speculating that buying them slightly larger is the trick.The price is very good for the quality of the shoe.
They have excellent traction.
The soles are firmly glued to the uppers.
The leather is smooth, flexible, and takes water repellent spray well.
I absolutely love these!!!
These are comfortable and have helped me tackle a few beginner - medium difficulty hikes in Banff :)
Looks great, have enough space for thicker socks.Lace up easy, have foam at top to ensure extra comfort at boot top!
Love it.
I bought the black water proof, I think I will get a tan color too!I do recommend this boot to all hikers, beginners or advanced.
Good price as well!
Thanks Amazon
I wore it for the first time to go inside an old copper mine (which was super cool by the way) and I was sooo happy I did.
They are so comfortable and supportive.
Definitely recommend!
I have been on multiple hikes that involved snow, water, mud and the shoes are fine and working.
It's worth the money.
Great boots.Ordered them for an upcoming hiking trip.
2 short 20 minute walks at home to break them in a bit and they were comfortable for both.
First hike was about 5 miles and my feet were happy the whole time.
Put them back on for a shorter walk an hour later and just as comfortable as the morning.
I gave this a 5 star because it is really comfortable and supports my ankle.
They fit perfectly.
4 days in the Tetons hiking all day long in all terrain, including a LOT of snow, and these held up beautifully.
I was wearing perfectly appropriate socks (fancy SmartWool specifically designed for hiking).
Love how they look, they're strong, lightweight, great ankle support.
I am very happy I decided to size up because I can comfortably wear thicker size in the winter months but they arent to big to wear thin ones during the summer.
I would have returned and gotten a smaller size because the shoes was very comfortable and felt like it would give good support.
If they could fix that issue in the toe box to keep it from caving in sharply I would recommend but until then I don't believe it would work well for long hikes.
Also, the price is great!!!
They are otherwise just fine
It keeps rubbing against my ankle and it created a blister, but either than that, the shoe fits.
They are so comfortable and the ankle support is great.
A very well made boot.
I am going to have such fun hiking and camping in these.
Excellent boot at a great price!
(I'm so happy with them that just bought pair for my daughter for Christmas!)
These shoes worked amazing!
I love these shoes and will purchase the same pair once I wear these down from more hikes!
450 bucks if they last a year I will be very happy.
Love these.
I have wide feet and these are so comfortable.
Look great.
Super comfortable and stylish this is my new favorite!
Excellent comfort great arch support!
These boots are amazing & should be the official boot for delivery drivers everywhere!!
I put thousands of miles on my boots each month and theyre lasting me approximately 5 months.
They fit perfectly!
They're not awesomely slip-proof, but at least it saved me from falling on the ice and down icy stairs (which definitely would've happened otherwise).
I've also had a chance to hand wash and disinfect these boots, since I went caving, and they're still perfect.
Boots fit true to size!!
Love them
These shoes are fantastic!
They are definitely not feminine at least not the color I got, which I didnt love.
They are so comfy and so nice and so sturdy.
Theses are my favorite shoes for work.
I spend 10 hours a day on concrete and the inside of this shoe is supportive and comfortable.This is my 4th pair of the same style.The last ones were over a year and a half before the insides wore out.
I wore them on a 2 mile hike immediately after taking them from the box and they felt great.
General construction of the boot is well done.
Fits to size as expected and is a good looking boot.
I love these shoes!
So far these shoes have held up well and are very comfortable.
Very poor quality must be made in China these days.
Good for snow and ski.
Though wearing them around the house/yard they have a wonderful fit.
This are perfect!
Absolutely love the ankle support.
These are great.
I love these boots Ive been buying them for years in mens for my hubby so I finally decided to get myself a pair and Im in love!
I used wool socks with silk liners and stayed warm and dry on the snowiest of trails.
I used hiking poles, but the boots gripped well on steep, icy trails.
On the warmer days I was still comfortable.
They are VERY comfortable!
I HIGHLY recommend!
I wore them hiking on rock in the Grand Canyon and in Sedona and they had great grip on the rocks.
Good support, toe box is perfect if you dont have wide feet.
Overall good hiking boot.
For the price point you get what you buy.
 * WHY there are ZERO ankle straps on the back of these boots makes UTTERLY ZERO SENSE to me and the voices in my cranium.If you can please include those on these boots, that would make them utterly PERFECT to me!!
She loves them, she talks about them while hiking...every time...  Look at the beautiful waterfall and the rainbow coming off of the spash!
I wore these on a 7 mile, pretty tough , hike and they did awesome!
They also have good grip and i never slipped on the bad parts!
But all in all great shoe and very happy with purchase (: i ordered the red and black and it looks just like the pictures!
I really love these boots - the way they looked, the way they fit- room for a heavy sock, they didn't make my foot look HUGE, are comfortable with the heavy sock you would wear with them without being tight and they are waterproof!
I wear a size 8 and my toes hit the front of this too tight boot.
Very happy with my new boots I use hiking, and camping
They are cute, comfy and true to size.
Very comfortable and offers great ankle support!
I added some supporting inserts and the comfort level of these was amazing.
For the price point these are a good sturdy boot option.
Again, nice support insert and these guys are awesome.
I took these boots hiking at the Grand Canyon, Big Sur, & snow shoeing at Lake Tahoe all in the same week without breaking them in and they did great!
I can definitely say theyre broken in now.
I also found they run a little big.Definitely worth it!
My first hike with them happened to be a great test of the waterproof quality- a cold rainy hike on a flooded trail- my feet ended up being the only dry part of my body.
I figured Columbia is a good brand, I already have some winter boots made by them and they are still awesome years later.
They fit great, are very comfortable, have excellent traction.
stone stairs, grassy hills, steep sloping mountains, gorges, through river beds and rocks.
They were great no issues at all.
Comfy fit, true to size.
I NEVER leave reviews, but I was pretty amazed at how well these performed.
But the other size fit perfectly and she said she was very comfortable hiking the White Mountains of New Hampshire with it.
So comfortable and easy to break in.
This was the best shoe I could have asked for!
Did a 12 mile hike with this and my feet felt amazing!
Any other shoe would have caused blisters, etc.
I also had so much grip with these shoes even though I went through a lot of water, deep inclines, climbing, etc. highly recommend!
I have not tested them for real hiking, but as a walking boot they are nice looking and comfortable.
This has a lot of rocky inclines and some bouldering.
Love these shoes.
Fairly waterproof and cute.
Added some insoles and good socks and we are good to go!
Would recommend!
Fit perfect.
I highly recommend these!
I highly recommended them to my son, and he bought himself a pair, and also likes them.
I love that the support my ankles.
Better than hiking on my 6 year old nike shoes.
The black hiking shoe seemed to fit the bill.
All five members of my family used various sizes of these boots (men's and women's).
We were all completely satisfied with the fit and comfort in the toe box, width and length.
Highly recommend.
I took these boots hiking through the red rocks in Arizona and into the Grand Canyon and they saved my life quite a few times.
Their traction and grip was remarkable and I would recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable pair of hiking boots.
I wore them around the house for one day and they seem comfortable enough.
I got a half size bigger than I normally wear so that I can wear heavy socks and the fit is good with the socks.
Otherwise, theyre a great boot!
Took me up Mt. Whitney, White Mtn, Pacificos Crest Trail, and more!
They are comfortable and they look very nice.
I highly recommend these boots to new hikers.
They seem to fit the bill.
Definitely waterproof.
Sent back a different pair from another company and was so happy with these.
Highly recommend them.
They held up nice and my feet stayed dry.
Love how these fit and look on, but took on a hiking trip and the rubber on the soles was coming unattached just after the few day trip.
My wife loves them, very comfortable, fits great.
Probably just need to treat the leather.
Best hiking boots I've ever bought!
It fits well.
Great for work.
Looks great  and didnt get chew marks?
I am delighted with these!
Love these boots.
I maintain both my parents yard and ours.
Well made.
Very comfortable.
Highly recommend these boots
I work in the hottest time of the year but I dont feel as though these shoes make me feel overheated - they definitely need to be Febreezed at the end of the day, though.Fit as expected, and the high-top fit of it is comfortable and protects me from the elements.
These shoes are great!
I was surprised that they didnt need much wearing in at all.
Super comfy, great for walking and climbing.
I highly recommend!
Ped #5 que es mi talla habitual y me quedaron un poco flojas pero esta bien porque as puedo usar calcetas gruesas y supongo que un numero menos me hubiera quedado muy justo.
I wore this to a festival in the desert for 4 days and never thought about my feet when wearing them, which means they were awesome!
After reading reviews about the lack of arch support, I did put Dr Scholl's arch support inserts in them and that made them perfect.
As for width, I have a medium to wide foot and felt they were almost too wide but with thick sock, they fit well.
These are very comfortable and warm, with excellent treads for snow, ice, and hiking.
Good price 4 real leather and Columbia sports brand.
Would recommend!
These held up great during my trip to Alaska!
I was planning on using these for a winter backpacking trip, so I would hope they keep my feet warm, comfortable and somewhat waterproof (I still planned on using a waterproofer just to make sure).
They are very comfortable and a great quality.
The leather is good to keep the water out.
The laces are a little stretchy and the bright red doesnt match the coral on the boots but overall very satisfied.
These boots are the best!
Highly recommend a pair of thick hiking socks to help prevent blisters as well.
Amazing boots for an amazing price!
HIGHLY recommended
Used the boots for the first time on a 6mile hike they felt great!
I work in very damp terrain and these boots keep my feet warm and dry throughout my day.
The fit is good, and still have some toe room.
Once the inner seam softens a bit it wont pinch the top of the toes, but it is a real thing as other reviewers have said.
They are flexible and light weight, but still durable for rocky terrain.
Tried putting some soles in them, tried lacing them better, got longer socks, still had awful pain.
I love the look of them, which sucks.
These boots are wonderful.
They are waterproof and hold terrain very well.
They also match pretty much any outfit.
I have used them on boulders and large rocks that are up to roughly 60 degree angles and terrain steeper than that and they have not let me down yet.
These boots are good for the price point, and Im pretty happy with them.
I also find these very hot and my feet are usually soaked after wearing them for a day.
Wore for 3 hour hike right out of the box.
I recommend these boots, great value for the price, and I have recommended them to my friends.
Ive only worn these a handful of times so far (maybe like 5-10 times) but its always been through puddles since it is spring time.
Super cute.
With thick socks they are perfect!
I really, really liked how these boots looked but the 8.5 (my size) was just a little large.
I'm sure these are fine boots but I returned them and decided to try a different brand.
Have been looking for a good looking yet comfortable walking/light hiking boot for a couple of years now - this one fits the bill.I have serious,very heavy, non-flexible boots ($250 range) for serious difficult hiking.
Wanted, and couldn't find, a middle weight non-clunky, solid color boot
I paid $62.00 and bought the grey pair as well.I usually buy my boots a 1/2 size bigger for using thick socks or extra insoles for comfort.
The 1/2 size up from my normal worked well.
Otherwise comfortable.
So happy I bought them.
My suggestion to others would be to buy your normal size and one size bigger...and then decided which fit is better.
These boots hold up, theyre waterproof and comfortable!
Love this brand (I always buy my winter coats from Columbia) so I tried these.
I am so happy!!!
The boots felt good intitially.
I would rate these at a 4.5.
They are fine with a thicker sock.
They sit right at the ankle and will rub, but the material will bend with motion.
They're very comfortable and warm.
Highly recommend for the price!
However, it sounds like sizing up is the best way to go!
Definitely worth the buy as long as you size correctly!
Fit is great on these.
For the price and practicality these shoes are definitely worth it, and they're a lot cheaper than Tims.
These are great!
I was really scared, though, since I have osteoporosis and it could have been a lot worse.
As it was, I was picking gravel out of my palms, had a big knot on my knee at first and I still have a bruise on the bridge of my nose.
I ended up just closing the hooks with a pair of needle-nosed pliers to keep that from happening again.
Traction is really great especially on uneven/slippery surfaces.
Great looking boot, but ordered my usual size and it was a half size too small.
Like other reviews state, it would be in your best interest to go up half or a full size.
Anyway, they're comfy, they fit great, and held up to my 'test hiking' the first day I bought them.
This is a strong, well-made shoe.
I definitely recommend them.
Very comfortable.
The only issue I have with this shoe is the way it "breaks" when you hike uphill.
The crease in the toe box is sharp and can hurt your toes if you aren't careful.
Overall a great shoe.
These are a rare boot that actually looks nice.
Very comfortable.
But for all around city or weekend hiking, they are perfect.
Best boots ever owned!
So pleased.
They fit really well and I have room for hiking socks and feet swelling.
They are waterproof, so that makes them kind of warm.
Ive been hiking a few times and kept my feet warm and dry in the snow and muddy trails.
I read many reviews and picked these and very happy with my choice
We go backcountry camping so comfort and good ankle support are key plus a reasonable price.
She needed decent hiking socks to give the boots a good fit as her feet are narrow but overall very pleased with this purchase
They fit fine and seem to be true to size, but they feel a little flimsy and fit and feel more like sneakers than heavy duty boots, which is what I'm looking for.
These were great for a trip to Iceland.
I did use inserts and wore multiple layers of socks and it was still too big.
I love these shoes!
My first pair of hiking shoes and they kept my feet warm and dry even at 20 degrees.
I would definitely order a .5 size bigger.
Other than that, they are really nice and light weight.
I have a medium high instep and I walked in comfort the entire trip.
Great looking boot but I returned them due to the toe box collapsing.
Surprisingly the same boot in the AMPED version fit great and didnt collapse so I bought those instead in the store.
This boot is warm and waterproof and runs true ro size.
Dont typically right reviews but these shoes are comfy.
Novice hiker, so I think they worked well for me!
I went with a 1/2 of a size larger, due to my feet swelling when I hike and they were perfect.
Colors are great and I had no issues with breaking them in.
These boots kept my feet warm and dry, even standing in puddles for extended periods.They fit really well and are super comfortable.
Ive been on two hiking trails in Texas for the last two weeks and I love these boots.
They provide great ankle support also.
These are great simple hiking boots.
Excellent ankle support as that was crucial to me.
They keep my feet comfortable after 10 miles, they keep them warm in snow, they keep them dry from water or mud.
and they're easy to keep clean.
I work in dog care and the like so- im always walking, running and getting dirty.
Wore these shoes for an overnight trip with 9 big dogs and they did great with keeping my feet from feeling like death and they were an easy wipe down to get rid of mud.
Haven' t hiked with them yet, but seem very sturdy, well-made, and they're comfortable.
It should be one price, whatever color you choose.
As a geologist a good pair of hiking boots is a must.
I wore them for a weekend straight recently and they were awesome.
They are a tiny bit more narrow than i prefer but for half the price of keens i am very happy.
They will be traveling with me this summer to Colorado and India and i will update after those trips to see if they are still comfortable and how they hold up to 2 months of straight use.
These shoes are a dream!
Im quite clumsy when I walk, and I knew it wouldnt be any different while hiking, but these kept my feet safe with the awesome ankle support.
For reference, Im usually a 7.5 in women but I sized up to an 8 and, paired with some wool socks, they fit perfect.
Happy trekking!
Great ankle support and the hold up well climbing up mountains.
I have not used them in snow or very rainy weather but so far they have held up pretty well.
They have great support, not arch support really but they keep me from overpronating which takes pressure off my arches.
Otherwise, they're really comfortable and cute.
These are comfortable and durable
These boots are great so far!
I would definitely recommend these!
Fit true to size.
Originally the price caught my eye, but the quality sold me.
Waterproof, leather and comfortable.
Plenty of room and nice color and laces combination.
I love them!
Work great with these shoes.
Theyre stylish, have good ankle support, and are about as comfortable a boot as you can find.
Works well with any kind of casual attire (like jeans) even when you're not hiking.
I have a large foot (size 11 and on the wide side) and after reading the other reviews, I decided to go for it with these boots and ordered my regular size.
I'm so glad I did because they fit and felt great on my feet right out of the box.
I've never owned Columbias before but I rarely experience this much ease with purchasing shoes and having them fit well immediately, so I'm already impressed.
I have yet to go on a hike with them and will certainly make updates here if my experiences change, but so far while wearing these hiking boots for a few hours here and there to break them in, I am more comfortable than I am in most shoes.
I love these boots!
Also, they are attractive which can be harder to find in hiking boots than one may think.
Honestly, I love this shoe.
Bought it so I can do a lot more of hiking and for the first time I did put them in use it worked very well.
I did a 24 mile hike, back and forth, on a dirt trail to Havasu Reservation and it supported me very well and it is very light.
Other than that I love it!
They fit just right and they are comfortable.
Fit and look great, none slip soles
I'm so happy I did.
I had honestly been looking at these shoes for months before I took the plunge and bought them.
I almost never write reviews, but I definitely 10/10 would recommend.
I have these shoes for four days already and I must say the experience wearing them is priceless.
No blisters and they look awesome.
There was no special needs for breaking them, I just put them on and was good to go.
I love these boots!!
Only because I love the color red.
The boots are comfortable, my feet stay warm & so far they've kept my feet dry!
They look great!
good waterproof and all-weather protection.
The sole is tough, good grip in terrain.
I bought my pair after my mom and a couple of my sisters each got some and loved them.
I absolutely love this boot!
These shoes are awesome.
They fit perfect.
They are light weight and made extremely well.

However this shoe was so comfortable and helped me last all day long without pain.
Love these hiking boots!
Very comfortable fit and true to size.
I was looking for boots that give decent ankle support but are still flexible, and these boots definitely provide that.
Will definitely purchase again once I need a new pair!
I love them.
Excellent fit and support and they look fantastic too,  Perfect hiker.
I have terrible feet, so I need a good stable yet comfortable shoe for walking.
Not only are they comfortable, but they hold up very well.
I love these.
They are also very warm, which means they may not be great for warm weather.
Not sure - just got these and was impressed by the massive positive reviews.
I never write reviews for products but these boots are great.
These are great quality for the price and $20 cheaper on here than from the actual companies website.
Wore them for a 7 mile hike right out of the box and was fine, no blisters or rubs.
Definitely worth the money!!
I bought these for a week of hiking and they held up great.
They were comfortable and supported my ankles well.
I read many articles on best hiking boots and this one was in the top 3 in every article.
I opened the box and let me just say this is a beautiful boot.
I love the colors and it is not too chunky looking, a really pretty boot.
I put the boot on and it fit perfectly it is very comfortable.
I thought to my self, Ive got the perfect boot!!!!
O-no this cant be right, the boot is so pretty.
I know finding a good quality comfortable hiking boot is difficult but keep looking, these are not the shoes for you.
The shoe is fantastic but it does bend when you walk and makes that toe crease so your toes might get irritated after a long day of walking/hiking
These boots are comfortable right out of the box!
I wasnt able to return/exchange due to the time limit.
But overall great shoe!
Fit perfect.
Comfortable and warm.
My son wears them as snow boot, he liked the color so that why I got the boots.
They are truly waterproof and fit well with regular socks.
They were a little stiff when I first wore them, but they are molding nicely to the shape of my feet.
I would recommend these boots to anyone who likes to hike over rough terrain.
Love these !!
Definitely follow the size chart and go bigger if you're in between sizes.
My feet are a little on the wide side so they took some breaking in but all in all very good general use hiking boots!
Theres good arch support.
Price is right & so is the fit!
I have previously bought the Women's Dakota Drifter Trail Shoe, also by Columbia, and had good luck with them.
I found that these are true to size.
So far these fit the bill.
These boots fit me perfectly!
I hiked 5 miles the first time I wore them and they were very comfortable.
The toe area did fold right above my big toe so I can see how others found that uncomfortable, however, it was not issue for me.
I am really pleased woth this purchase!
Fits well, I made a mistake in wearing short socks and I got blisters on our hike.
Waterproof and sturdy hiking boots give my flat feet the strongest support.

I bought them in hopes of something light wieght, rugged when on rough terrain, and waterproof, I am very happy with the product.
They laces stay tied and they come to a good spot above the ankle and are supportive.
The color hasn't faded and they keep the moisture out very well.

The boots were perfect for my hike through the Guadalupe National Park in West Texas.
They are also great to wear in the cold just running errands.
I loved the look and fit of these shoes, I was really excited trying them on.
The fit was true to size.
But then I started walking around my house and immediately noticed the material above the toes caves inward with every step, and presses firmly down into my knuckles.
These were perfect even handed angels landing like a champ!!
I LOVEEEE these hiking boots and I always get compliments on the looks.
It was a great purchase!
Definitely recommend.

I make sure my shoes strings are tight and not missing a hole and they are high top boots.

These are perfect.
They give me some traction on the ice.

I will say better big than small.
I would recommend these boots.
Super duper cute.
They are perfect for hiking.
Bought to go to the Smokey Mountains wore them all day and my feet felt great.

Walked up and down steep hills and had good traction.
They keep my feet dry and warm.

I have not tried it in water yet, but the three hours of being in 15F and with warm toes , I am very impressed.
Bought these for my wife, she loved them and she is VERY picky.
Very comfortable right off, no wearing in issues.
very comfortable.
Now I use them in my regular hiking trails.I'm happy with my purchase
They arrived in time for a solid week of rain at home.
They're snug enough and true to size.
Very cute hiking boots.
Completely waterproof although they do not keep your feet very warm so I would recommend wearing warm socks.
The fit is actually great and they're very comfy and cushy as long as I'm literally sitting still doing nothing.
Light and comfy.I love it!
Very pleased with these shoes.
I was pleased when my shoes didnt get any water in them too.
I want to love these boots because in all other ways they seem to be a great first pair for day hikes, however the crease at the toe that other consumers mentioned is something I noticed immediately upon trying them on, prior to reading any reviews warning about it.
Loved these boots.
Excellent purchase and value for money.
They provide very strong grip and also help keep your toes warm with proper socks.
Worked out great.
I wore them all day running errands and for a long walk, my feet stay warm and they are so comfortable!
Was very comfortable from the very first time of wearing them.
The fit was perfect.
Also love that they are waterproof.
As long as water doesnt cover the very top of your boot, these boots will seriously keep you dry.
Theyre great with traction up and down hill, on gravel (as good as they can be), stone, etc.
I love these boots!
But I love the fit and seem tough.
Several friends of mine have Salomon hiking boots, and their feet feel fine.
With all the good reviews, I am thoroughly disappointed with them in longer more difficult hikes.
I like the color & the size is perfect
These were comfortable right out of the box.
I like the fit and quality.
They are light and keep my feet warm.
Just perfect I tell you.
Love these boots!

Just got back from 10day Iceland trip and these shoes worked in all different weathers and terrains.
Absolutely love my new hiking boots!
Super comfortable, easy to break in (with the proper socks), durable in snow or gravel/rocks.
I will more than likely buy another pair different color ?
muy lindo zapatos, livianos, llegaron tal como se ven en la foto, la talla es la que indica.
I hike a lot for work, and these are excellent in the mud and on a well-kept trail.
They're impressively waterproof (though note I also sprayed them with a waterproofer).
We do a lot of hiking.
these boots have been great for that.
She likes it a lot.
Aside from the crease at the top, the boot is comfortable and waterproof.
Waterproof and comfortable for driving and multiple hikes!!
The shoes fit very comfortably, yet I feel that there is just enough space to wear thicker socks for colder weather.
Love the cool wave color!
Comfortable and fit well.
I wore these on a 3 hour hike and my feet felt great.
Definitely go up a half size or so.
I wear a womans 9.5 (difficult to find in stores lol) and after taking the time to break them in, these are wonderful.
I contemplated between this and a cheaper pair, but I knew this was a good brand.
And its worth the extra money.
True to size, feels perfect, love it
Stylish and comfortable for the most part.
Definitely break in, hopefully these will be more comfortable after a few wears or Ill look for better hiking boots.

They hit ankle at just right spot.
Good traction and good looking to boot.
When they arrived, I thought, "Okay, I'd better break them in or I'll have blisters on the trail."

The waterproof uppers even held up well during a pond-filter cleaning.
I only hope the rest of me feels as good as my feet will!
Excellent fit, lightweight and great tread......
nice price.
Totally worth the buy plus good pricing.
Very comfortable, definitely great on terrain & snow.

I went a half size up and the fit was good.

Got these as a Christmas gift for my Mom.
She wears them daily & absolutely loves them.
Thanks for such a great product!!!
Keep up the good work!
They are so comfortable and I look nice on!
I have slightly wide feet and when I tried these on they definitely werent a comfortable width.
Well I tried both the 8.5 and the 9 and in both cases the crease in the toe box rubbed uncomfortably right off the bat.
These were really comfortable and way lighter than the boots I was using before.
Overall great stuff.
Comfortable and well made
I love these boots, have 2 pair.
They are true to size and fit comfortable.
Priced right.
I tried tons of boots and this pair was the perfect fit and very comfortable.
A 7.5 is perfect with thick socks.
So it should fit fine.The shoes themselves look good and feel great.
Used them on a 5 hour strenuous hike in the Great Smokey Mountains.
The boots have decent grip only slipped a few times after it had rained but not before and we were hiking near cascades the entire hike up.
Worth the investment.
I liked how comfortable it was .
It was a hit .
They were comfortable from the moment I put them on.
These are the best boots I've ever owned.
Overall these are great hikers
They have great traction for all kinds of terrain and I was surprised with how light weight they are for hiking boots.
Love the ankle height as well - feel like there is good support there.
I love these hiking boots!
Was able to learn that the first day wearing them.
Waterproof and sturdy which is what I've liked most for my hikes.
I'm taking a hiking course that involves bushwacking and hiking up creeks and these boots keep my feet warm and dry, even when I've been walking in water several inches deep.
I wanted a sturdy but light weight, waterproof, year round usage hiking boot that was attractive.
So far I have only worn these boots once, however I have to say they were a great buy!
They fit well and will be comfortable once they have been broken in.
I highly recommend these boots!
Theyre great for hiking, and walking in nature.
I ordered my regular size and it fit comfortably with hiking socks.
I highly recommend this shoe!
They are very comfortable, waterproof, and very easy to clean.I would suggest breaking them in before going on a long hike as they can be a little uncomfortable initially on the toe where the boot bends at the crease
Yes.
The shoes are wonderful.
I added my custom inserts and it made them feel even better.
I am a size 8, I ordered a 9 to give me room for orthotics and thick socks.
I love these shoes and I dont feel the need to "break" them in.
They provide great ankle support.
I love these boots!
Very Comfortable, fit is true to size!
It was also pretty chilly when I went and they kept my feet warm!
I would recommend a size or two larger.
I normally wear an 8.5 and thats what I ordered and they seem perfect.
Good choice.
My wife very happy on her new boots
I bought these boots to hike Mount Washington, NH and they were amazing!
They have really good traction on ice and mud.
They're waterproof and very comfortable.
I highly recommend these boots!
Very comfortable
good deal through amazon, very happy
it fits perfect, the size 7.
very comfortable.
Very foot study.
Love them!
Absolutely loved these, ordered them for a hiking trip in Tahoeand didnt bring any other hiking shoes but I didnt need anything else!
I have reviewed many shoes and bought plenty of hiking gear, these were one of my best purchases!
Still healing a week later!
Feel great...thinking they'd make a wonderful everyday winter shoe!
Great fit hiking the narrows and for motorcycle riding
In this price, they are really really good.
We were not sure of the size and fitting when purchasing online, but we were surprised when the boots arrived and they were of perfect size and fitting.
Its really good for hikes and even for straight walking/trekking.
They arent super grippy so watch out when its wet outside, but overall , good sturdy boot!
I hiked a glacier, through a forest and rocky terrain with stability and no slipping.
Also the issue that other reviewers stated about the top toe area hurting their foot, I definitely see it and could feel it but a pair of super thick hiking socks help to ease this discomfort!
These were not for me and I will be returning them and buying one that is higher quality .
Very lightweight, sturdy, and room for toes.
Tried them out for a light hike and was very comfortable
they are great for hiking & snow too since they are waterproof (note: my area only gets a few inches of snow).
They did take a little breaking in, but they felt fine after the first hike.
I thought I had to size up but this boot is true to size.
I recommend ordering a size larger.
After broken in these shoes are pretty good, I actually use them for work, all day moving and they feel secure and comfortable.I have plantar fasciitis so I do change the insoles on all my shoes, I recommend the Spenco gel.
Run a little big but overall great hiking boots.
Also, wear higher socks because hiking a lot in them rubbed my ankle raw, but thats to be expected with new boots.
Overall, they seem high quality and very sturdy.
Happy with my purchase.
They were warm enough with wool socks that my feet were never really cold and they were light weight and comfortable.
I have high arches and will definitely need to get an insert.
It fit as expect, i wear the sports shoes  5.5 and it is 5.5 fit exactly.because i have not wear it yet only try on for a few minutes then i can't say muchbut it looks and feel strong.
nice look though
They are beautiful to look at, lightweight, I love the shoelaces, and they offered a great ankle support.
my enthusiasm changed after a two minute walk in my living room, the toe area on both feet started to be extremely painful and after a while I simply had to take them off because of the intense pain.
They are very comfortable and keep water out.
Once this comes apart the boot is no longer waterproof but this takes a lot of ware and tear before this will happen.
The lack of a proper sizing chart really screws the whole thing up, because the boots themselves looked incredible.
After a week of walking around in them they felt much better.
I stood outside in the wet snow with my kids for nearly an hour and my feet stayed warm and dry.
Wasn't very sure of the true size, would recommend to get actual size and a size bigger using prime wardrobe and then check for yourself, wearing thick socks.
Thought I was getting a comfortable warm hiking shoe.
Size I would say runs true.
I love them!
Perfect fit and comfortable enough to wear all day the first day!
I hike with my dog all year and these have been great.
Perfect.Looks gorgeous.Fits perfectly.
Comfortable.Built to perfection at Vietnam.
these are really nice and comfortable.
color and look of them is really nice
Love them!
I hiked about 5 miles yesterday and fell in love.
I have very narrow feet, size 7.5, and was able to wear wool socks.
Found these to be a fantastic first pair ? no blisters but I assume all boots have to be broken in, so even if I had got any I understand that pre broken in boots is comical.
But I will try tightening the laces to see if that helps.
These are really nice.
The style is great, the smooth leather easy to take care of, and generally comfortable except where the leather bends at the toe and hits my toes.
The fit is good, the sole is hard and therefore I am not sure as we go into the winter season how much use I will get from these and I doubt if there is room for an insole to help with that.
I'm very happy with these boots!
Impressed with the grip and overall comfort.
I also liked how easy they are to take on and off.
But theyre comfortable because of the way theyre laced.
I love this product.
I put them on perfect fit.
These held up great!
They keep the water out and are very comfortable.
Great arch and ankle support!
I love them!
Havent been able to check out if tread is good since snow has been washed away by rain.
They were a great buy.
I was even comfortable on a 10 hour hike up a steep and muddy, rocky volcano.
Make sure to always bring the laces all the way up to the topmost hook and tie there.
They have been great for hiking as well as work boots.
In their first wears, my big toe began to hurt because it bends right onto my toe, but I'm sure as I break this in this will go away.
The toe box was wide and tall enough that I didnt have uncomfortable contact, but the depth and location of the pinch when you walk in them (where the crease would form in the leather) pinched down deep right onto your toe.
I bought a 1/2 size bigger than needed for when I need to wear extra socks.
Looks good!
Stylish and comfortable.
Toe area was comfortable, which is a good feature.
The boots fits and feels great and the look good too.
They are very comfortable and light to wear.
I love the boots so far, I just got them today.
Very happy with these boots.
These boots give the support I need and are quite comfortable
My daughter loves it.
This shoe fits right and is very comfortable (so far).
we plan on a hike soon and hope it holds good.
I had pretty low expectations because of the price but they ended up working out perfectly.
I highly recommend these.
I would recommend these boots to anyone.
They are great in all aspects except I wish the manufacturers would offer a higher arch support.
Great purchase, super comfy and perfect for my hiking trip I felt very secure with these boots!
They look amazing and felt great but REALLY tight on my toes.
My toes are sensitive to rubbing from shoes, but I thought, for the price, I was willing to try them out.
They are very comfortable!
I knew / know nothing about "good" brands or anything, but I am impressed with the quality for the price!
Amazing purchase
It was wet and rainy the entire time and my feet stayed warm and dry the whole time.
Bought these boots for Alaska and they were wonderful.
These were extremely comfortable afterward.
The only downside to this boot is that it does pinch your toes.
Best boots ever.
Super comfortable.
They worked exactly as I needed them to and fit perfectly to size.
Extremely comfortable and sturdy.
I took them through rain, snow, ice and mud and they came out perfectly.
I would buy these shoes again in a heart beat.
Such a great product for the price.
These Boots Are so comfortable I wear a size 11 in womens and Wow what a fit!!!
But these are very comfortable and thus far durable for hiking.
Love these boots!
Perfect fit, great grip for walking around icy roads, warm and kept my feet dry.
The right boot fits perfectly and feels great.
Very comfortable and good looking.
I've just returned from spending a week in the woods with these babies and I'm in love.
The best hiking shoes I have ever worn.
Great tread for climbing on wet rocks and rugged terrain.
We are about to go to Glacier National Park on our honeymoon in a few weeks, and we both agreed that these shoes will be perfect for her.
I have the men's version of these boots, and I love them.
She also loves them because they're "cute", so I thought I'd mention that also.
Look good so far!
Love the style and have been comfortable for short trips so far (itching to get them on the long trails).
Love so far.
Waterproof is perfect for my kayak camping trips to come.
Follow all of the reviews, I am an 8 generally and I got a 9 to be safe and they fit perfectly with just enough room for thick socks!!
Truly amazed by these boots I love love love them!!
These are the best hiking boots Ive ever owned!
Super comfortable and durable.
Columbia always makes a solid hiking boot.
Make sure you are wearing good hiking socks with them.
Helps with additional comfort.
I took these boots to Isle Royale and they performed great!
The price is great for the quality.
Did a one-hour hike up Mount Philo... Shoes were perfect!
These are great hiking shoes, especially for the price.
I like the look of these best but when walking around my house I started the feel pressure on top of the big toe (exactly as many reviews stated).
They provide excellent traction & I'm definitely happy with my purchase.
Good,  sturdy and comfortable!
Very true to size.
I highly recommend them!
Love it it!
Was really please with my purchase!
Id strongly recommend wearing with above-the-ankle socks.

The Best Boot from Columbia.
Completely Waterproof and fit true to size.
Great for Walking, Hiking, Any type of weather and I even wear mine when I ride my Motorcycle too.
I absolutely love my new shoes.
Warm and dry, great traction so I'm not sliding all over and my feet have been warm and dry in this wet cold weather.
The part I love even more is they look like regular tennis shoes not big and bulky like most hiking boots but have all the same expectations.
Very satisfied.
Nothing, its a perfect fit.
Wow finally a pair that fits.
I haven't hiked in them yet but I'm hopeful that they will be perfect for me.

I am planning to replace the insoles to a more comfortable insole.
Otherwise a great hiking shoes.
Shoe looks great but runs a little big.
Great fit and very waterproof!
Best $80 I have ever spent.
I love these.
They fit well, didnt cause any blisters breaking them in, and have decent grip when hiking up rocky, muddy, or rough areas.
Very good quality shoe for me after having reconstructive foot and ankle surgery.
Needed the arch and ankle support!
I ordered a half-size up to accommodate wearing heavier socks, and they are perfect.
This morning it was about 20' out (warm for here) and I walked with warm toes for about 3 miles.
Good support, waterproof, nice looking.
Worth every penny.UPDATE: After 2 winters, salt deteriorated the lace hardware and it is all breaking off.
Not happy.
Very lightweight and comfortable.
Well made & very comfortable.
True to size , I almost went with a wide width but glad now I didn't as its a perfect fit.
Extremely comfortable could wear them every day.

They have excellent ankle support.
Great for light hiking & taking walks in a rainy city.
Great shoe for its intended value and looks great!!
Such a comfortable boot, waterproof,  and the non-slip sole is a bonus
I am breaking them in before I a major hike.
These shoes worked great for hiking with my boyfriend.
They worked extremely well through the mud and my feet did not get wet at all throughout the entire 8 mile hike we took.
They also fit perfectly, they are true to size.
Comfortable, waterproof and true to size
These shoes are amazing.
Very much so worth my money!
After doing a lot of research and shopping, I finally decided on these hiking boots.
I absolutely love them.
They are extremely durable and the waterproof quality of them is incredible.
I would definitely recommend buying these!

Awesome shoes, bought them for hiking in the Grand Canyon in Janurary, through snow, some ice, slippery mud, solid mud, and sand.
The shoes did great!
I bought mine a half size bigger because I wear wool socks and they did a great job.
Received as a gift.
Have really held up well.
For looks, fit, wearability and value, these boots get a 5 from me.
We ordered 2 pairs one mens and the other womens....these fit like a glove we both are in love with these hiking boots!
We hiked a trail at Grandfather Mountain this weekend through tons of rocks and water and they were amazing, waterproof with superior grip.
Again we are both pleased with them and if we wear them out we will be ordering again.
I ordered a size 8 because I have a Columbia boot in that size, but this fits a little bigger than expected.
Very comfortable and looking forward to using them in Alaska
Love these!!
Very comfortable
Otherwise they were great for hiking!!
I love them!
Definitely waterproof!
Price is good too!
I was a little concerned when I first wore them as they seemed a bit bulky and my feet hurt a little, but once I put some foam inserts in them (in all fairness I use them in all my boots) I was able to hike all day in comfort.
I love these boots they are warm, I can walk right on puddles and they stay dry and toasty all day long!
I would definitely recommend them to anyone, they are very good quality and materials and does the job for a harsh winter.
They are also cute looking!
I'm very happy with them.
Therefore, I don't have much hiking experience, but I would greatly recommend these boots to anyone.
Highly recommend!
Very light on the feet, so I don't feel like I've got concrete block on my feet.
Love, love, love these hikers!
These fit perfectly (10.5) and are very cute and affordable!
the tight is good because it doesn't allow my feet to move around in my shoe when I'm hiking.
they are also pretty good looking.
I'd recommend these to anyone who does hiking
They did fit out of the box but a little big -some thick socks and they were perfect!
They look great and should last me many years.
Very happy with my purchase.
Great boot for walking/ hiking.
Light weight and comfortable.
They look great and are lightweight.
First, I can definitely feel where they will get that toe crease and I could tell the first time I put them on.
These hiking boots are awesome!
I was debating between getting wide or regular but the regular fit just fine.
Super comfortable and have great support.
Used them literally every day on a 3.5 week trip all around the United Kingdom, walking through puddles, mud, and cold weather and my toes never got wet and I had great support in the arch and ankle!
I looked up the shoe on Amazon and was so happy to see a 10.5 available as often, an 11 is usually a bit big.
I have been wearing these boots around the house the last couple days and they feel wonderful.
Good boots!
Completely waterproof!
Grip on the bottom of the shoes is fantastic!
Very comfortable.
A very good purchase.
Thick and warm shoes.
The quality isn't quite there.
The price is good but just spend the extra $$ to get a good pair of hikers.
I am very happy with these shoes.
I have looked for black hiking boots for awhile and I love these.
Great fit and looks good on the foot.
Love the shoe and everything about it!
Otherwise a perfect shoe!
I am not a super frequent hiker, but whenever I do, I use them and they are sturdy and reliable, but still feel very comfortable!
They fit really comfortable,  and they look good!
I absolutely love these boots.
Recieved in a timely mater, shoes were comfortable right out of the box
Could use a bit more arch support but overall I am very pleased.
Especially for the price.
I was surprised how comfy they were considering that they were fresh out of the box stiff.
That gives me hope that they will only improve.
They are very comfortable and sturdy.
I needed some boots for hiking while in Rwanda and normally I don't buy shoes online, especially ones that I need to trust for support, but it was last minute and I made such a good decision.
Everything was true to description
I wore these boots hiking the mountains in Australia all I can say is WOW, so comfortable.
Saved my feet, my lungs well thats a whole other story.
Amazing shoe.
Fits very comfortably.
The shoes came right on time.
Very happy with the purchase
Hiked all weekend long in Michigan's upper peninsula through mud, water, rocky cliffs, etc, and have no complaints whatsoever!
The 7's were a bit loose, but I wasn't wearing proper hiking socks so I'm sure with thicker socks they'll be just fine.
Would definitely recommend!
Read reviews and ordered half a size larger, it fitted perfectly so thank you reviewers!Took them in an intense hiking trip this past weekend and they were perfect!
No blisters, perfect fit, good traction even on slippery areas (sand, loose rocks).
I wore them with tall, thick socks just to make sure my feet were protected and I felt their ventilation was very good.
Used for hiking and worked well.
I love them!
They are very light and fit amazing on the foot.
Very comfortable and not too heavy.
Keeps my feet warm and dry in rain.
I walked around in them briefly and they are really comfortable and seem to have good bend and flexibility to the soles.
I'm really picky when it comes to my shoes because I have plantar fasciitis, but I think these are a great pair of boots.
Great looking boot.
Comfortable fit and surprisingly easy to get on and off.
I loved how this boots fit my feet.
I had tried these pairs at a local retailer.
I have gone out for a hiking already, and they are very comfortable and light.
But this 8M fits nice while other brand's 8M seemed too tight for me.
Excellent fit, comfortable and provides top support during arduous hikes
Great boot when it comes to waterproofing and ankle support but got a giant blister going downhill after a mountain hike.
I love these boots.
I really don't have much to compare with, but these are great.
Love em
They are waterproof and have good grip when climbing on wet rocks and crossing rivers.
Highly recommend getting these for such a great price.
Wiggle room in the toe box is good and can accommodate a heavy sock.
Amazing hiking boots for almost every weather condition.
Very water resistant, walked through nearly ankle deep water without my socks getting wet.
Very comfortable, light weight.Only con is that the tongue tends to jut out and needs adjusting here and there regardless of how I tie the laces
I work production for festivals, so havign these boots when the fields are soaking wet is perfect because they are completly water proof.
The ankel is great for support for long days of walking or hiking.
Good grip on them.Cons:However, I read a lot of reviews before purchasing these boots and trusted them but my boots did not meet my expectations.
I love and trust Colombia, but these boots get extremely hot with a little sunlight.
The cholla went right through my boots!
Great service, everything arrived as described.
Fits true to size with room for thicker socks as well.
I love these!
So comfortable.
Fit well, good to walk and hike.
These are really cute, and the ankle support is really comfortable and flexible.
The traction on the sole is great, so I could also wear them in snowy Michigan.
They keep your feet dry and warm in the snow!
Great boots!
Very good looking boots!
Comfortable and sturdy!
Comfy and warm, true to size, just the crease above the left big toe started to hurt Im hoping they will soften up and that will go away
My wife absolutely loves these boots!
In fact, she stated that they were some of the best boots she has ever worn!
All the shoes made like this dog into the top of my foot about an inch above the toe range.

It took time to the shoes to feel really comfortable!
I love these, they are lightweight but provide the support that I need for plantar fasciitis, oh and hiking!
I really wanted to love them.
They run a bit narrow for hiking boots and also rub above the inside of ankle.
Great fit, comfortable.
Love the shoes!
They are perfect for cold weather or warm.
Best boots to have if you like to go abroad and travel.
I love the color.
They have great traction on hills, gravel and mud and are true to size.
Cleaned up well after a spray with the hose!
Overall I don't love them but still good quality.
I wanted something supportive around my ankles and good thread.
I'm currently wearing them now to break them in and they are amazing.
Best hiking boots Ive owned!
Sometimes the top can rub my ankle a little sore but nothing a good pair of socks cant fix.
Would buy these again absolutely!
Very comfortable straight out of the box.
Love how lightweight these are!
I love that these look a little casual and I dont feel out of place wearing them out and about for whatever were doing before/after a hike.
She needed something sturdy and waterproof, yet all of the work shoes she saw in stores were either ridiculously heavy and steel towed or aimed toward people that do a lot of walking indoors.
I saw these and thought they might work and they are perfect!
Im usually a 6 and the size 6 fit perfect even with thick socks.
Im happy with my purchase :)
I love them.
Very  comfortable
Fairly warm, light weight, and waterproof.
They fit around my foot nicely, but they do rub on my ankle bones somewhat, but that is getting better the more they start to break in.
Just break them in before you go and these will  be perfect for you.
I'm only giving four stars because I don't know how much it will stretch once I've really broken them in, but the shoe fits very snug.
They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.
It's totally going to last a few years.
Really nice boots.
Stylish and comfortable.
They did a pretty good job of handling volcanic ash and sand on the steep slope.
I would highly recommend.
Better than expected.
Being waterproof was just a bonus!
The color is a nice cool gray, with just the right blue to accent it.
Very comfortable!
They are light, truly water resistant and I was able to hike 11 miles without any issues the first day.
But they have held up beautifully.
Fit great, such high quality boots for the price.
They are warm but still wearable in the summertime.
The traction on the bottoms its awesome- used them in the desert and the snowy woods.
Great boots and are waterproof.
I'm so happy I bought these.

I broke them in on a 6 mile hike on the Blood Mountain loop, and they did great!
I use these boots for work and the first pair lasted me for almost 3 years of continuous use.
I like the boot, it fit well just not as comfortable especially at the toes where the boot bends.
Even with thick socks it would still have a great fit!
The shoe is made with great quality and is very comfortable.
And it is extremely stylish too!!!

Did not fit, but looked very good quality
I liked the fit and comfort of the first pair so much, I ordered a second, then a third.
I like the look of them and will use them in the winter when it snows.

Great purchase and would get another pair.

Super comfy like a tennis shoe but with the extra support and functionality of a hiking boot.
And they are very sharp looking.
I love these.
I was really nervous about ordering shoes online because of how they might fit but these fit me perfectly!
I feel they are of great quality and I can't wait to hike with them soon.
Not worth taking a star off though, I love these shoes so far.
Very comfortable and stylish boot.
I was very happy with them for a month.
Money very well spent.
Great guy!

I tried them with and without my orthotics, which usually work great in boots.
These are my first pair of hiking boots, so I may not be an expert in this area, but I think these are great.
They're incredibly comfortable, have solid ankle support, and my feet stayed a comfortable temperature for a 3.5 hour hike (and wearing them for the following 5 hours).
I'd recommend these shoes to others looking for a low-cost but comfortable and reliable hiking boot.
The fit and feel are great.
The boots seem sturdy, well made, and good looking for the reasonable price so I returned the first pair and am waiting for the smaller size to arrive.

I had a pair of columbia boots I bought over ten years ago that I wore off and on, very comfortable and rugged, but they finally fell apart in hikes in colorado mountains.

Great shoe for camping &  hiking.Fits true to size.4 stars only because they arrive very stiff.
Wear extra socks while breaking in to avoid blisters.
Very light weight compared to other boots.
They hold up very well.
I add insoles for extra support.
I bought these because most of the reviews I read were positive.
Fit perfectly after breaking them in.
Boots are CRAZY STIFF which I was not really expecting but overall they're good.
Amazing comfort.
The boot seemed like a great fit until I did a real hilly hike and it isnt designed adequately to keep the laces tight enough to support you when you are extending your ankles.
I kept tying them and on rocks the sole isnt thick enough to protect you for more than a couple miles.
My favorite boot!
This is my 3rd pair, 3rd color, and always quality product from Columbia!
Super comfortable shoe and gets feet warm!
I love them they are sooo comfortable

These boots combined a strongly made, robust exterior with the comfort required for long periods of walking/wear.They fit very well and are standing up well to the rigors of frequent wear.They do clean fairly well and the soles give the required amount of grip, whilst 'encasing' the ankles to good effect - providing the support needed.
Excellent boots tha are sturdy, well-made, and are as good as new even after two or three months of quite heavy use.
Durable and comfortable.
Sizing is true.
They are light weight and very comfortable.
They grip my feet very well which make them handy and more comfortable for.long hikes.
The sole provides very good friction and thus firm grip on the ground.I have tried them on few hours of hiking on wet grounds (after rain) and also on normal walks.
Good solid walking boots that will be ideal for bad weather.
Size 5 was a perfect fit.
Nice shade of dark brown.NOTE: She says she doesnt wear brown shoes at all.
Best hiking boots ever!
I've walked through grass, forests, beaches, and mud in these and they are so durable and waterproof.
I am very pleased with these boots and they exceed my exprxtations!
Very cushioned and comfortable, look forward to trying them for hiking
Very good feeling, but unfortunately they are too narrow.
